oh that is good you prepared but that is terrible timing !
that is the worst ! . mine was up extra late tonight too .
i hear you ! i was college roommates with my sister and now we live hours apart .
"awe , i bet you felt so proud and happy for them ."
"i know , they can be amazing when they are learning and exploring the world . . . however , i still do not think having a different colored cup than the one they wanted warrants the response they tend to give . i have a year old and a year old son"
did she jumped really high or something ?
oh i am sorry to hear that . are you doing okay ?
"aw , i be so . how old is he ?"
that is normal . we all get nervous on our fist day of work .
i think so too ! i swear it was like yesterday .
"that is insane . i heard that the older you are , the faster time goes by since the percentage of your life that a specific amount of time is gets shorter and shorter ."
i am sorry to hear that . are you doing better now ?
no way ! what happened . . . was there a confrontation ?
"oh ok . i take it , he was cat calling ? there are classier ways of appreciating art ."
that is pretty funny . did your sister ever find out it was you who took it ?
what would you have done in that situation ?
"awe , i am sorry to hear that . do you think there will be any chance of a reconciliation ?"
"i know it is not my place to ask , but why did they disown you ?"
"in the end , i hope she sees that you were able to make it work , and if you can and do , she should meet you half way . you are very welcome"
serious ? do not you like pizza ?
haha that is terrible ! unless he was hot . . .
oh really ? ! is she not afraid of the dentist ?
"you and the rest of the world , lol . joking . joking . why are you furious ?"
"of course , hindsight is . but going forward you can live in a way that minimizes regret ."
it is really not for them to judge . do what makes you happy .
you should always be confident and take risks in life .
i second that . i have been to all the parks a bunch of times .
"work hard at it , poverty is no joke . not an option !"
that is great ! you must have good credit .
in what way are you fearful ? i have never thought about that before .
wow . . . that is exciting . congratulations ! i also won my fantasy football league this year and won as well .
i know the feeling . seeing my friends kid read the books i used to read brings back great memories .
i still love going on planes . makes the headaches of airports worth it .

i always wondered how you start something like that up with your partner without hurting their feelings .
how terrible ! i bet your heart stopped in that moment .
i feel you . i also get sad when i see people living of the street .
why ? is it something with your work life balance ?
oh no . i am so sorry . that is so hard . my daughters cat got run over like a week after we had him . what was your dog s name ?

"wow , now you have a brother , that is good to know"
"hello my friend ! i will gladly wish you all the luck in the world , if you would only tell me what i am wishing it for !"

"that is good , do you like nice cars ?"
"you must be really happy , i bet you have a beautiful wife and lots of money in the bank"
"i understand . i have been lonely most of my life . but , it gives it back and it makes up the loneliness part ."
i can only imagine the destruction and how horrible it is to deal with that !
"thats great , i feel there is someone out there for everyone"

it is one the worst pains . you would think we d keep our toes more protected

"definitely . if you can motivate and get on a schedule yourself , you can save a lot of money ."
what is the position ? are you going to apply for it ?
"oh wow , what do you plan to do ?"
are you sure about that ? i bet you are more than average .

i bet ! does your family do a large dinner as well ?
how did you fix it ?
what did she say ?
how come ?
how many series did you watch ?

i love to be able to help people when i can also .
i know the feeling . i wish we could take away the pain for our kids .
that sounds shady . did it ever get worked out ?
oh that is terrible ! kids are so mean ! what did you do ?
what happened to make it that way
"yes , it is hard to see people you know and care about struggling . are they doing better ?"
that is great ! are you getting better at driving ?
thats good to hear and do
how did you do ?
that is outstanding ! i bet you are excited !
"that is the greatest feeling in the world , to see them smiling ."
i would be scared of that

"wow , that can be stressful , why were you happy ?"
maybe she should have just quit ! but i hope the best for her in the future .
when are they ?
"oh , did you lose it somewhere ?"
"ah , that is no good ! why did not you get to leave early ?"
"wow congrats , how long have you worked there ?"
"i feel like since the show , catfishing has decreased a little bit . it is easy to determine when someone is using fake pictures ."
no i did not that is pretty awesome lol . . . is that the show where celebrities get slimed
was it a surprise ?
"i am so sorry , what happened ?"
i saw that . it was pretty crazy !
wow thats a good feeling to have
well that sounds just wonderful ! what kind of entrepreneur are you ?
did you try talking with your supervisor on ?
"that is really weird , did he actually knock the tree down and how thick was the tree ?"

"i know the feeling of finish finals , but not with all a s . congrats buddy !"
awww man that stinks ! i thought you two were going well .
"i agree , people who catfish need to get their priorities straight ."

being sick does stink at times . but at least your husband is there to assist when in need .
"what was the game ? that happens to me all the time too , it is a treat to remember such great times ."
have you asked them ?
what happened ?
"wow , i hate when people feel like it is okay to waste other peoples time ."
"aww , it is amazing how fast time flies and how quickly kids grow up ."
did he lose it ?
"ouch , seeing that news probably knocked your mood down hard ."
im glad to hear it brought memories and not tears ! its hard losing a parent .
oh really ? is there any specific reason why ?
that is awesome ! got ta take credit for those genes haha
i absolutely agree with that mind set ! pick something you are passionate about and do it with passion !
about what exactly ?
why do you hide it ?
it must have felt good to see him after such a long time .
"they are just kids , i think you should give them toys to play with and also take a pain killer"
i think so ! that sounds like you worked so very hard for the company !
i am glad that it is
where was it to ? ?
i have never been in an eating contest ! how much jello did you eat to win ?
what was the prize for winning ?
"yeah , those are rough when you are so hopeful about it ."
i bet . . what did she pass away from ?
i hope she is okay
so many people are .
did you call to complain ?
i am sorry to hear that . why would you considering putting it on hold ?
that is disappointing . i wonder if you can see if anyone you know is doing it and they can hype you up for it .
oh no . . . will you tell them ?
what job ? do not be discouraged if you do not get it though ! keep trying !
woah ! that is super scary ! did it do anything to you ?
i am sorry to hear that
what happened ?
thats a good bond how long have you been together ?
was that the only time you stole in your life ?
how is everything coming together ?
that is sad
i bet that was not a great feeling .
that sucks ! have you been able to contact the bus company yet and get it back ?
oh no ! would your phone cost a lot to replace ?
"wow that was a long time ago , i am sure that you regret it now and have learned from your mistake ."
its okay to stay at home
most kids are like that . i was definitely scared .
do not be . i am sure you are ready .
awesome ! where are you going ! i am jealous !
how thats cool .
"that sucks to hear . i do not know too much about basketball , to be honest . was it really a big deal ?"
"so , you are not anymore ?"
why does he do that
that is extremely lucky . it is nice to know there are still good people in the world .
"oh no really , that really sucks to hear . why were you not able to go ?"
"i am sorry , they are sweet animals"
oh i hope she got better
why did she break up ?
that is bad . i feel sorry for you
i felt the same way .
that is never a good thing to do
"surely not , do you trust her ."

why are you happy
i am so sorry to hear that .
i am very sorry to hear about your loss . take you were very close .

"that is sad , did you move away from your parents ?"
did he just come back to you ?
"oh no , did you ever get caught"
"i bet you were , poor pup"
oh my gosh ! did you run and hide ?
oh gosh i hope so too !
wow thats cool !
did it get resolved
well you should always think that . it is not hard once you get into the groove of it .
i guess guys tend to do that
"how old were you ? that can be dangerous , you hear stories of people falling in all the time ."
i am sorry to hear that . have you tried looking for him .
what position did you play
because of my illness i got some frustration too
"wow , i sure beat he beat your butt , i bet you thought you had it in the bag , rigtht ?"
for sure . trust is a key driver in having a good relationship with anyone . if you can not trust people then you will feel like you are alone a lot .
how often do you eat it ?
oh no . what happened ?
we have all been there . how did you do ?
yeah that does make you feel good . but make sure it is a good charity .
well dang ! are you feeling alright ?

a for creativity .
seems like things turned out for the better . what is she going to do with the winnings ?
how exciting ! where is your friend originally from ?

big mac s are heaven in your mouth .
i stayed at home i hate trying to fight over that off pack of pencils at staples . what did you do ?
"i am sorry to hear that , what led you to this ?"
why is that ?
that sounds fun ! you must be really happy about it .
why didnt it work out ?
are you attending post secondary ?
thats cool ! what band is it ?

that is awesome ! what do you go to school for ?
s doing well and he s my buddy for sure .
he must love his grandkids .
"do not feel bad , many people are experiencing the same feelings . try to focus on meeting new and interesting people !"
that is not fair . why didn
that sounds pretty admirable . what kind of animal ? dog ?
thats very admirable .
"i am about to watch it ! please do not spoil it . i am excited for it , even though i have only seen a couple of tv shows and movies based off of his books , and only read a couple of the actual books"
did you ever come clean ?
"i am so sorry . our pets are not just pets . . . they are part of our family . go through the grieving process , even if it takes time . you deserve that ."
are you deep in debt with medical expenses ?
law school wow
"that sounds like a sticky , stinky mess ."
i completely understand . i will be starting law school myself very soon .
sorry to hear that . i am in the same boat . at least i have two dogs with me . do you have any friends around
some dogs can be very intimidating . i can understand that . did something bad happen ?
that is not nice .
"that is rough . i have been around my siblings kids long enough to know how rough they can be , even though i do not have my own . how old are they , if you do not mind me asking ?"
that is awesome . long distance can be tough .
"dang , that is quite an achievement . everyone loves a good redemption story . how did you cope with it ?"
that is horrible . i would hate to have to deal with that when it is not my fault .
when did this happen ?
"falcons fan , huh ? that is cool . i like the green bay packers . you guys knocked us out of the playoffs a couple years ago because of our bad defense"
that was smart .
why would you think that ?
it really makes a parent feel bad when that happens . i live with what my neighbor calls mom guilt .
you can still exercise now .
i am sorry to hear that . do you think you struggle to communicate with people ?
it is stressful situation . i hope your brother find time to help you .
"that is crazy . snakes are one of my worst fears . was it poisonous , do you know ?"
"wow , you are ? how did you find out ?"
thats really awesome that they are still so much in love . do you have a significant other ?
that is so awesome ! so many times they do not come back .
i am glad to hear . what kind of surgery ?
"i hear you . i have had to change the diapers of my nieces and nephews for the past years , as they ve come and gone ."
i hate that . flies and gnats are so annoying
i am glad your ok .
are you a big football fan ?
how exciting ! when is the wedding ?
"i have n t won on a ticket in a long time , but i once one ! ! spend it on anything fun ?"
why did you lie ?
"whoaa . . . . you probably had to throw that away immediately , huh ? do not worry , my sister in law forgot to put eggs in a cake one time and it came out like a brick ."
"whoa ! that is incredible . what caused the change , finally ?"
it is wonderful to have a good parent . they really do shape their children for better or worse . i am so glad you have a great mother !
that is odd . . . usually buses are always on time . maybe the weather had something to do with it . i am sorry to hear that happened to you . all dried off now ?
big dinners are always a great way to tie everything up at the end of the day . was it a pretty long day for you ?
i am sorry . are you sure you did that bad ?
what shows are you thinking of specifically ?
"oh wow , i hope you are fine !"
payday is the best day ! what are you doing to do ?
oh that is horrible . who s brian lawyer ?
"i have never heard of him , but that sucks . how d he die ?"
what is the name of it ?
"ohh no , were you pulled over wrongly ?"
thats great news .
did you really steal it or was it more like borrowing without asking first ?
what show was it ?
that is a tough one . do you eat out a lot ? that is usually the culprit . i had to learn how to cook for myself so i could afford to live .
those jobs are hard . you can always try it and see if you like it . i recommend a temp agency they often have nice desk jobs . some even offer work from home jobs .
that is terrible . was it an expensive one ?
"i am sorry to hear that , i hope he is in a better place now ! how old was he ?"
right on ! that is cool to hear . everyone likes to rag on older people driving . glad to hear she s the exception . what kind of car does she drive ?
i have a friend who plans ahead like that . i am a last minute gal . i think you will be less stressed by planning ahead .
"oh my god , i would have been so embarrassed ! how d you react ?"
so you left work at lunch time ? did you come back or were you too ashamed ?
"dang , a whole two weeks ? going anywhere , or just hanging out and really enjoying yourself at home ?"
good to hear you are confident ! i am sure you will do well if you ve been studying .
"yeah , everyone speeds . terrible to get caught . hopefully you were not speeding in a neighborhood , were you ?"
do not go check it out . that never turns out well in horror movies . bring a gun then or another person .
yikes . . . sounds like they need to hire better people . hopefully the noise is not too loud in the morning
that is lucky !
"seriously ? how ? what was the mistake ? did you talk to him about it , or your boss ?"
wap you must be disgusted with the farting . were you mad ? or are you used to this kind of situations ?
sounds like the good old days seemed more relaxing and care free .
yeah . . . that is a tough one . i have pirated stuff before . kind of how it goes as a poor college student . maybe when you get older you can pay for things appropriately .

that happens sometimes . maybe next year .
i took my kids to the beach and now every time we leave the house they ask if that is where we are going .
did you get lucky and some kind person turn it in
that is horrible . just think it could have been worse . you could have wrecked and totaled a car or a house burnt . lots of things are worse .
glad for you . a girl i know was walking to her house and a car hit her and killed her . so it is just money and can be replaced
omg . i would have been so scared .

hope they do not find out . were you just tired or something else ?
"well , next time try telling her the truth , like , i am too tired right now , can we do it another day . and that way you will not feel bad ."
i am sure she would understand if she is a good friend .
that is true . i am glad i live in an apartment .

"do you ? you should trust her , that is what marriage is about !"
i am really sorry . do you have house insurance ?
yes . . . but in what context

"wow , how exciting . i bet it looks like a fat little old man ."
i would hit it out of spit now

a lot of kids these days are addicted to technology . does she listen to you often ?
that is great . sometimes family is not good with loans .
"wow , they are still making them ? only ones i enjoyed was mw , mw , and bo ."
what is your favorite dish ?
i bet you find someone soon
sounds like she s going to be on master chef in a couple of years . what did she make ?
thats sounds promising .
"aww , that is sweet of her ! you are lucky to have her , not all moms are good ."
"that is pretty sweet of her . some people would find it annoying that their parents still want to baby them , but i say you should n t take it for granted . they just want to be in your life ."
eating vegetables is disgusting to me so i just blend it all in a smoothie . you should try that
i hate that feeling . hopefully you will feel better about it tomorrow .
"well at least after the storm , there will be some sunshine !"
"that is horrible luck ! at least you were not hurt . some insurance companies cover that as well , so you should check ."
"oooo , that sounds fun . will you visit that giant place where gladiators fought ?"

"my friends and family always talk about that show , is it good ?"
ive been there
are you sure it was not palying dead ?
i am sure you will knock it out of the park . what is it on ?

you can always give them some money once you get yourself back on your feet . just keep your head up things will get better .
cool ! what did you get ?
investigate that right now ! you need to know
wow . i hope you have studied hard so you will do well .
oh my goodness ! did you get hurt ?
"yeah , that bothers me to . do not sweat it too much though . just consider it their loss and move on ."
"you got this bro , just be confident . i believe in you"
that is so great ! are you in the process of applying now ? i am sure you will get in eventually .
"that sounds interesting , is it hard to make ?"
that sounds like fun . but i do not think hillbilly is a very nice way to describe people .
exciting ! did you get any neat gifts ?
that is always fun . did you win any money ?
"that is terrible , are you okay ?"
"i believe in you , man . i am a bit rotund myself , but i started hitting the gym this past week ."
for what ? are you a diver or something ?
my dog does that too . i think it is the loud noises that scare them .
"haha . these dogs that i am dog sitting would n t let that happen . they wake me up at am every morning to feed them . but hey , we make mistakes . maybe you had a busy day today ."
what is a aardvark ?
"you usually do not get that much jail time for drunk driving if it is your first incident . it should n t be so bad , but hopefully it will make you more cautious in the future ."
"oh , i am so sorry to hear that . did you get her something nice ?"
that is gross .
that is so nice ! did she like your craftsmanship ?
nice ! did you manage to snag the promotion ?
oh my goodness ! i bet that was embarrassing . but it happens .
that is nice . what kind of computer did he get ?
how did that experience go ?
i would too . what had happened ?
how old are your kids ?
what can you lose ?
do they have insomnia ?
"that happened to me too when i was in elementary school . i lost all my friends and had to make new ones , which sucks ."
i bet she felt really special !
me too . i miss payments sometimes because i forget about them and i am lazy .
"ah , so you are in the same boat as me ? i can understand how that goes . electricity is so necessary nowadays , too ."
smoking is pretty bad for everyone .
i like dogs
can you get another job ?
"yankees fan , huh ? i should pit you against my brother . he loves the red sox . i bet you guys would argue for a while ."
"that sucks , how old were they ?"
it
have you asked him how he feels about that entire situation ?
"really ? that is one of the saddest things i have heard in a while . i am sorry to hear that . what happened to your family , if you do not mind me asking ?"
did you do anything after she did it ?
"why s that ? did you specifically have a bad experience with them , or just assume they are terrible no matter what ?"
some people are just cruel .
"that is annoying . kids these days are really attached to electronics , just how it goes . i know it is hard to cut them off , but have you tried managing his electronics time more closely ?"
did you practice first in a parking lot ?
i can understand that . i feel like trump should have gone to jail a long time ago
i think they are just empty threats but you never know .
why do not you move back ?
oh no ! how many days left until she starts school ?
i am totally with you
how old is he ?
indeed . it would be fun to see your friends again and be around them
how much is the phone ?
oh no . did it ever come back ?
where did you go ?
awwww i can relate to that . i am so sorry .
who was it ?
"i am not too fond of winter , but what kind of coat did you buy ?"
when does he start ?
you may have more than you know but sometimes meeting new people will give you the fresh start you need
where did they come from ?
"i am not particularly a fan of subways either , but why are you so scared of being robbed ?"
so i take it you get along well with your boss ?
that really is disappointing . can you fix it ?
did you hurt yourself ?
i am sorry to hear that . why do you think that is ? is it a painful or happy memory ?
it is these delicate balance of our natural body that makes us to be diligent for survival
"i bet that was a nice surprise ! that is pretty cool . what was it for , if you do not mind me asking ?"
"wow , that is amazing ! shows that we can not judge a book by it is cover . we automatically think it would take a large man to do something like that !"
"dang , that is rough . like a double dose of sadness . my girlfriend and i are long distance , so i know how that goes . is there any way you can still keep in touch with them ?"
"yeah , she and i do not use social media , but i can imagine that d be really helpful in your case . well , i am glad you at least have that . and maybe it will open up the possibility for you to meet new people , too ."
was it for school ?
that is a little daunting . have you considered joining some groups with like minded individuals ?
aww ! how sweet ! i can imagine the first few days are crazy .
"aw , that is fantastic ! how did yall meet ?"
hopefully a happy birthday is going to be in order soon !
oh really ! any ideas why ?
"yes , they can be fun i guess ."
that is so sad . did the kitten die ? i hope not .
"no joke ? that is terrible . why was the security camera off ? and seriously , who steals a lawn mower ? what bums ."
"oh wow , what luck ! i bet you slowed down after that !"
i love colorado .
it is . now we have to deal with rains and snows . so much to go for the next summer
why did you decide not to go ?
what is the big end goal ?
that is not good . what is wrong ?
"oh man , that would make me angry ! is there anyone you can call and report them anonymously ?"
oh no that would make me feel guilty ! ! ! is he okay ?
who did you leave him with ?
that sounds great . what do you get to visit for ?
i was too ! what do you think caused it ? !
what state is that ?
i am sorry to hear that . it always sucks missing the good old days .
that is incredible . what a determination and dedication he must have put for achieving such a result
"wow , i have never been ! what all did you see ?"
a part in what ?
that is rough news . how long ?
what kind of puppies ?
oddly enough so am i . i just want to be comfortable . how do you feel about that ?
did you spill something on it ?
are you excited about it ?
maybe you should take a different class .
especially getting gifts from family . what a special holiday this is

"i would cry , very much !"
worms ? yuck !
what are you going to buy ?
i had to use a subway once to get to work on time .
do you enjoy your free time or are you sad ?
"cool , i have a pair of jeans ."
did you get sleepy while studying ?
i live and take care of my grandmother too !
that is understandable . you need to let it happen naturally . be with your friends and find yourself
did you not want to leave them with someone else ?
vegas is always a popular destination for vacation !
that is terrible ! how did you punish your dog ?
what happened on it ?
that is good . some people do not appreciate anything .
oh no ! what happened ?
"aww , that is a nice story . i am glad you have that to carry with you ."
these nostalgic emotions are unique and very pleasant to have . i sometimes rewind them in my mind just to escape from my anxiety
did you ask why your partner refused . that is very weird .
i would guess that if your survival mode you will do whatever you have to .
what happened ? did you ?
tell me exactly what that was like ? hopefully it is different now ?
nice ! i bet it is a very cute puppy .
yes i am mortified jeans ripped
woah ! that is great news . have you told anyone yet ?
you are so right . it can make all the difference .
i feel the same way . there are so many people who are struggling now .
great so you found out already that you got it or are you just confident ?
ok you going to your family
that can be upsetting . did they tell you why ?
that is impressive . why did you doubt them ?
i hate interviews the most .

that is great
kids are amazing . how old are they ?

what does that mean exactly ?
ps is the best system to play on !
can you be more specific about what things you had lost in the past ?
i am with you . it is horrendous

that is nice . what show ?
because of the movie or where you were parked ?
that is awesome ! what was the project ?
i just got netflix back . what is good ?
oh no . thats sad . what was wrong ?
i could never ever sing .
"oh , what was your age when you ve stolen ?"
they may consider that shoplifting . it would be terrible to go to jail for grapes .
cool . are they still the same ?
did you party after ?
do not be daft ! kids should never watch tv !
they have tv inside the school do they not ?
why is that ?
what kind of job was it ?
i love apple pie . i feel you .
you are lucky to be able to have that kind of relationship .

really ? are you watching training ?
oh you mean soccer lol
how exciting for you .
what was the movie ? save me
i have never had a pair either but i do not despise them . why do you feel so strongly ?
yeah i do not see why someone would spend so much either .
wow . i have never even tried . seems complicated .
maybe i will try one day .

"yeah ? i am sorry to hear that . are you looking for someone else ? does that sound sleazy , lol ?"
"oh dear . maybe you do not need a man i am one and can confirm that they are messy , noisy and rude ."
it sure can .
i hate that .
"jeesh , was she not paying attention in class , or is there some other issue ?"
i could not imagine my kid going so far as to hide something like that from me . maybe she was just scared of how you would react .
"well you tend to be a bit overly serious about things , maybe you should try looking at the issue from her point of view you know ?"
thats cool .
oh . you are welcome lol
i read your journal
really ? why is that ?
i know right
why are you done with voting ?
i hate horror films too many nightmares .
oh no
that was nice .
probably im scared of birds .
"well its to be expected , all you do is sit in your house on the weekends ."
"well next weekend come out with me and the rest of the group , bet we could find you a few interested guys ."
"oh shoot ! what happened , are you okay ?"
i feel really sorry for you . will you be okay ?
"that is nice , do you get nervous ?"
"that is great , do you have a warm up routine to get your ready ?"
"cool , what do you do if you happen to be low on energy ?"
oh why ?
"i have n t seen it , but i know a lot of people like it ."
"sounds good , were you said throughout the series or because of an ending ?"
what about it is annoying ? isnt it better for the dog ?
i am sorry to hear that . are you ok ?
that sounds like fun .
why is that ?
well done ! do you get a prize or anything ?
why do you think you often feel that way ?
why is that ?
"that is wonderful , good food makes for happy people"
why not ? that does not sound fun .
absolutely . what happened ?
what kind of job do you want ?
"oh , wow . that is awful , i am sorry !"

i agree . i thinking making a list helps with that .

"that sounds amazing , good for you !"
i hope you didnt get any bad news from the doctor .
"uhmnn , so how do you think she would react ?"

yes that can be a huge problem . i am so sorry you are having to go through that .
"of course , i have felt sad for many reasons . things that happen in the world make me sad ."

oh that is so scary ! i bet you were terrified !
"lol , i think my son has done that , he use to embrasse me when i would go to the store when he was little by crying a lot"
i am guessing you are talking about your son ?
that is awful ! i hate people who leave their dogs out all day . that is no life for a dog to live at all .

"i have not seen a snake in the woods , have you ? that sounds frightening !"
what did you do ?
oh i hate when that happens . i am sorry you felt that way . did you not buy the dress ?
oh man . tha must have been so embarassing .
first way to overcome it is to figure out the reason for the fear
"oh wow ! that must have been frightening ! that sounds like an exciting experience , though ."
that is something to be excited about . how far away are you moving ?
it is okay . people are very understanding . did you underpay ? i am sure it happens all the time !
"i did . i once won , from colgate toothpaste ."
"i do use their toothpaste , but it was just an instant win contest online . it was years ago . have you ever won a cash prize ?"
i am sorry to hear you were feeling that way .
that is a cool toy you got for your nephew
that will help him alot
that is not so bad . everyone cheats on their diet from time to time . i would just pick up where you left off .
"oh how exciting , you must be proud !"
did you end up taking him ?
is he just naturally unruly or does he have some sort of condition ?
oh man ! i love pokemon ! the first one i ever played was pokemon blue .
that is awesome to hear ! your hard work has paid off .
good luck . i bet you are ready for this exam .

that happens sometimes . was it mistaken for something that might have been sitting there forever ?
"i am kinda the same way . although , i feel like if my friends truly care about me , they ll find out and remember my birthday on their own . no need to go blabbing to everyone about it ."
yay ! that is a difficult feat .
"have you tried taking any aspirin ? i feel bad for you , my friend ."
do you have any plans for it ? that sounds exciting !

"i have been there , my friend . but , the good news is , if you are not typically late for your bills , the utilities companies will often cut you a break ."
how did that happen ? i would be so upset .
oh well it is still fun that you got to participate in that .
"oh wow , did anything end up happening to you ? did you get years in prison ?"

and what happened ?
it sucks when you can not depend on co workers
"oh wow , i have done that before as well . you may have to deal with some indigestion ."
"oh no , you must have been quite upset . what did you do ?"
maybe it was a thunderstorm forming ? ?
really ? what did your boss do that made you so mad ?
that is great news ! what does he play ?
"those were the days , my friend . what kind of car did you have ?"
"omg , i do not think i could eat that many burgers in a week if i tried . what was bothering you so much that it lead to you eating so many burgers ?"
"that is sad , i wonder why the dog can not find a home !"
"oh no , i am so sorry to hear that . that must be so hard . how have you been coping ?"
what haha that is a real thing ? ? ?
"oh geez , that sounds pretty embarrassing . did any of the bottles break ?"
you should feel bad for just cursing at a lady .

"yes , i am as well . do you have any investments that could be affected ?"
"oh wow , do they taste good ?"

"oh no , i hate when that happens . people always feel a need to look and it causes the other lanes to be at a standstill as well . how long did you have to wait ?"
"so , the pup is healthy and situated now ?"
how exciting ! has it been a long time since you ve seen her ?

omg i am so sorry to hear that . are you feeling at peace at all now ?
that is terrible and frustrating because you can not really do anything about it .
"oh man , that sounds awful . i thought the hour drives we did with of us were awful ."
that is pretty amazing . i have tried juggling small objects before and felt like it was impossible .
i am sorry to hear that . what do they get treatment for ?
"that is nice , must have saved you a lot of time ."

we are too hard on ourselves ! we really shouldnt care what others think but i would have felt the same
oh geez ! that would suck ! i hope it was not a cold day ? could you drive home and get new clothes ?
wow ! how old is he ?
that sounds awful . mine used to have a bad group of friends too at one point so i know how it feels . sometimes you just want to yell grow up ! ! !
that is awful . it sounds like a freak accident . what happend ?
why were you nervous
i can imagine she and the school appreciate that

"i am sorry , how old was it"
what was your excuse ?

yes i do . do you ?
sticky paper is so gross . have you every used cloves ? you can put the in your windows to keep flies out .
i don r know . once i found out about cloves that worked fr me . maybe you should het an exterminator although that seems extreme .
"okay , how come ?"
thats pretty awesome ! college or highschool testt ?
i am sure no one noticed
so you did get it ?
i do not yet
new people make me so nervous .
i have never tried one of those . did it help ?
oh yeah ? i bet that was exciting for both of you . open house at their school ?
"i had an experience similar to that as well . their teachers look like they should still be in high school . but , they are so eager to do well i get excited with my kids for the school year ."
i love going to the thrift stores as well ! what did you by
having a few good friends or even one is better then having a bunch of fake ones . it is hard to make friends as an adult that are true friends even if you are great at it ! so do not feel bad
what does he do that scares you ?
"he may just be on a different time schedule than you . my neighbor does something similar , he mows his lawn at am"
wow . that must be nice .
"most of them are like that , or they are fixated by what everything costs ."
me too . i hope you have nice memories .
oh no ! what did you do ?
"oh , that sound alful ! some people have zero respect for others belonging and even less for things we all need to share ."
"oh ! i love the sound of rain , i could just sit in the warm rain too !"
"oh thank goodness ! if i may ask , what was he in the hospital for ?"
i hate when people do that
what did they want ?
did something bad happen ?
"i have heard of that , is it any good ?"
"wow that is crazy , sometimes not so uncommon depending on your area , sadly !"
death can happen in an instant ! i have been there the past year . i am sorry !
its always worth a shot
what did he do ?
"i do hate storms , they can be scary"

waiting always kills me ! how much longer do you have to wait ?
what happened ? ! ?
its a part of life you know
that is outstanding !
just tell her ? she will be grateful for the honesty .
did you jump out or did you brave the war and kill it ! ?
i feel the same way . i have social anxiety so standing in front of a crowd is pretty terrifying .
"yikes , i hope you have insurance ."
thats good everything is so close . it really helps out a lot and walking is good for you !
resist the temptation !
i love those moments where you get to see all the hard work get payed off ! how did she do ?
oh no ! i bet you regretted that fast !

i bet you were . that is a great accomplishment !
like years . i use emails a lot but i do not feel the need to use actual paper letters . it is !
"it seems like an almost unachievable goal , especially at my age ."

"oh my gosh , that is so annoying ! how did you deal with it ?"
"well that is good , are you enjoying the new stove ?"
it is always a bummer when you borrow something and it breaks right away . you feel responsible and have to replace it .

"a complete stranger ? how the heck did that happen ? i am sure you must be confident that it is safe , if they are staying with you ."
i think we re just another number for them .
oh no ! which author is it ? that really stinks when you can not finish a story . an eternal cliff hanger .
"wow . he did not get you one , hu ? thanks dad ."

those were the days . i remember buying cents popsicles .
what is it ? am curious .
"oh yes , and remember bagel bites !"
wide open ? or just unlocked ? that is crazy ! i guess you got lucky you did not get robbed or have some animals become new roommates . hard to believe decades ago people loved to go to bed with their doors unlocked .
that is really a shame . too bad they will not get help for the kids
that is so disappointing . will you stay there ?
that is really nice ! what does he usually get at the store ?
i love a good surprise party .
that really stinks . what game did she used to play ?
"haha , why ?"
i am having a similar issue . you shouldn t have to pay for a service they aren t providing .
shopping is fun ! what do you plan on getting ?
that
in terms of grades or something else ?
that is awesome that you devoted time to care for him ! how is he doing ?
"oh that is cool , having a nice new car always feel so sleek and cool ."
"ah ! that is always such a scary thing , because there is such a dreaded anticipation that goes along with it , a whole , will it ? will not it ? kind of game of seeing whether it will head in your direction . i live in the southeast , so i have dealt with worrying about plenty of them ."
i really hope he gets accepted !
i have never watched it but i have heard it is really good . maybe i should give it a try
i know the feeling .
nice ! what do you plan to do with a house empty of kids ?
stressful . was your work understanding ? is he ok ?
like the creamsicles ?
you would n t believe . i am eating one right now .

why would you think that ?
why would you think they are jerks ?
you must have lived there for a long time .
i am so sorry to hear that . it will get better .
nice and congrats ! how long have you been together ?
i am sorry who is going in too th grade ?
holy cow that is amazing ! good on you ! how much weight have you lost ?
where were you ?
did you forget your lines ?

"oh man , i am glad you did not get into an accident though . please be careful next time . did he give you a ticket ?"
they did ! that is so terrible !

wow . why ? lol . that is crazy
that is a great place to be . sometimes less is more .
you sound like a very faithful and loyal person !
i like not having plans too . i enjoy just relaxing sometimes .
my dad has diabetes too but he was born with it . i heard veggies help a lot .
"that is one of those things that never gets old to complain about , because it is one of life s time tested annoyances . and what is worse is you open the door or window for them , and they still refuse to leave . . ."

"oh no , that is terrible . can it be replaced ?"
that is sweet of her ! you should put them all together in a nice photo album .
sorry to hear that . sometimes there can be a technical problem
some people think they know all the answers . it is sad as they usually do not grow as much as people
"if you report him to his wife , the shame will make him pay you back"

oh i know that feeling . what are some of the things that you can eat ?
i do hate those too
sounds nice . . where did you go ?
"aww , that is terrible but good she has you . i have had many family members that had that fight ."
what did you do ?
i am not familiar with basketball . why would it be hard for him to leave ?
thats exciting . do they know what they are having ?
online classes takes some dedication versus going to class . good for you !
that is really good . starting off right is one of the most important things for a successful school year . where are you going ?
i am sorry to hear that . sometimes kids do not know how to interact well with each other . but it is an important part of the socializing part of life that they work their way through it . all you can do is tell them how to respectfully and appropriately respond and defend themselves .
it happens even when we study hard sometimes !
"i am sorry , was the cat okay"
good for her . never too late to go back to school .
i do not blame you . those things are creepy
"i understand that , i am not either with some of my family ! we are not always born in too families that are like us ,"
"i am sorry , are they very mean or abusive ?"
cat room ? i have never heard of such a thing .
did any of the cats get out ?
wow thats great
"yeah , that is never something to complain about well , unless you were fired , i guess , but that does not sound like that was the case ! i am happy for you , too . did you do anything fun with your extra time ?"
fun ! those can be addictive for me . i only get them around christmas time . . . not sure why but its a fun stocking stuffer . did you win ?
oh wow . . are you going there to surprise her
that is not good . so no way to get the info back
does your dad still live nearby ?
oh gross ! what restaurant ?
yea . floors get dirty pretty quickly with dust . will you be replacing the vacuum ?
what breed is it ?
wow . i hope it was a clean diaper .
"that sounds like so much fun . i hope you have a good , relaxing time . where are you going ?"
that is good . are you getting the hang of it ?
that sucks . what store is it ?
nice ! is this your first time having that done ?
"how come , what happened ?"
i love cheesecake
oh no ! was is plain or did it have sweet toppings too ?
what stores are you going to
oh my gosh ! i am glad you are ok ! ! !
oh dogs are so sweet . was it your first time ?
what did you do
"that is amazing , first child ?"
"is not that the best feeling when something you really want is actually on deep discount , and you are just in the right place at the right time !"
i am glad they won !
oh i bet you enjoyed that
"i am sorry , why did not he come ?"
that is not good . i am glad they are okay though
you seem a bit jealous .
how precious ! how old is she now ? what does the ornament look like ?
that is awesome . what subject was it ?
thats bad timing for sure
you are a good parent . how do you have space for it all ?
thats always a plus
does he live far away ?
what movie is it
that sounds amazing ! what do you have planned ?
that is so neat when friendships last so long .
no one came to take care of you ?
healthy is important
"oh wow , you must have been thrilled !"
"thats not good , i remember bad times at school . what happened ?"
one good friend who you can trust is better than a bunch you can not . it is just part of growing up sometimes . school can be an exercise in mental strength .
what kind of birds are they ?
that can be one of the hardest parts of life . very tough
"i am sorry , roommates can be annoying sometimes"
"ah ! that is kind of a scary thought , but i bet that would also be kind of fun . i live in a city with a very extensive history that is utilized a lot in haunted trips and stuff like that , so i have seen them around and have wondered about going on one . do you believe in ghosts ?"
that is really too bad . i know how that feels . have you tried telling her how you feel about it ?
sounds like a good kid . what has he been working on .
that is nice of you . where has he been ?
sometimes you got ta stand up for yourself .
"talk about an unwelcome guest ! i would have immediately slammed my door shut ! i never know how to respond in those situations , as in whether or not they are dangerous , etc . what did you do ?"
you are so lucky !
"that must be incredibly annoying to have to deal with . to constantly have to battle for what you feel is justified support , and to always be worrying about it in the back of your head . you have to be really resilient to go through that ."
do not be too hard on yourself . you taught yourself a lesson for next time .
oh no . i have experienced that before and its not pleasant . its hard to be kind and careful with your speech and actions when you are near a snob .
ugh ! so you have corrupt police officers in your town too ? that is a bummer !
your mom is awesome
oh yeah ? that sounds awesome . that is how it should be ! can you tell me a little bit about them ?
why is that ?
i hops so too ! work does come first or the bills can not be paid !
wow ! enjoy it ! what did you accomplish if i may ask ?
i am so sorry to hear that . when will you see them again ?
"there is absolutely nothing i can say to make you feel better about that . i am sorry for your great losses . just from those few sentences alone , i can tell you were very passionate about them . what were their names , if you do not mind me asking ?"
"oh gross ! i have heard of flies or ants being in an ear , but a roach ? that gives me chills because i hate roaches sooooo much . now i might have nightmares tonight !"
"oh , how come ?"
that is terrible
i can imagine that . i have never lived alone before .
that is great ! being without a job can be very scary
yu should report him
oh that could be tough sometimes . i am glad you were able to get all the ones you wanted .
my neighbors are terrible so i hope you have a good relationship
that is doing something . it is what we call relaxing .
that happens over time
"oh no , what happened ?"
"that is terrible , what did you do ?"
how was it ?
"yes ! yin and yang , it is hard to appreciate the quiet without the loud"
"oh , i love cleaning , so tools to do it with that are new are always welcomed . what kind of brand ?"
woah ! i am soooo glad you are okay ! those big rigs are so dangerous and make me so nervous . i stay as far away from them as i can .
"i completely understand that . things are always scary when it is happening to your kids , but there is hope ! have you ever heard of whole foods plant based diet ? or doctor fuhrman , or doctor michael greger ? i think it could heal your son !"
what happened to it ?
what are they doing ?
"oh lol , well it"
i feel sorr for the poor guy !
that is nice of you to say about someone else . it is nice when someone can recognize someone else s hard work and dedication without feeling jealous or annoyed . i am sure he knows how proud of him you are .
oops . that is does not have to be a bad thing . no one can resist fries from mcdonalds . how did she react ?
you must really miss him ! so glad you will finally be reunited with him .
i have never done that before .
it ? have n t heard of it . what is it about ?
that is a great idea ! for what cause though ?
oh no . that has happened to us so many times . i thought fidh were easy
people can be inconsiderate sometimes . i hope you do not get sick !
"oh man , costco pizza is great , and so cheap , too . it may not be the best , but for the price and quantity , you can not really beat it . do you like shopping at costco often ?"
that was so nice of you . what did they need to use it for ? were you able to live without it ?
that is terrible . some people ar just no good .
family conflict is always hard . maybe you do not need to take a side and try to work for peace .
"whoa ! was that a good surprise , or a bad surprise ? i could see that going either way , but at least it would be exciting ! i had that happen when i got one for christmas . well , actually it was in my parent s bed , and i barged into their room to ask if we could go downstairs and open presents , and i saw the one they had gotten me and had been hiding to surprise me with ."
did you call her ? i hope she s ok !
"oh , that is kind of nice . it is nice to have those natural landmarks near where you live , so you can visit them and get a sense of relaxation and peace . i have lived near the ocean all my life , and while i do take it for granted from time to time , i try to remember how useful and beautiful it is ."
that is awesome !
oh nice . what will you be binge watching ?
she will do great . or she might not want to have kids be he is such a handful
"that is terrible . sometimes it is hard to know who your real friends are , and it takes repeated attempts to hang out with them , only to have them bail on you , to realize that you are not valued by them . i say cut your ties sooner rather than later . life s too short ."
"wow , that sounds exciting !"
"oh god . someone did pick up their dog s poop , hu ?"
i bet it did .
oh that was good of you .
oh haha i know that feeling .

oh god that is terrifying haha . i hate snakes .
"that is tough . i have two older brothers , so i know how that is . we re separated by four and eight years , respectively , so we were not as close as you two seem to be , but i always liked having them around ."
"your husband sounds awesome . that is interesting that you are the type of person that actually likes birthday parties . most people i know would be too embarrassed or self conscious to enjoy them , and they d feel uncomfortable . especially me . but for you , i am glad you can get into them ."
oh no ! my gut feels sick for you having to go through that . it happens to all of us but its so painful and awkward . how did the neighbors take it ?
that is cool . when did you learn ?
oh that is rare . how come ?
"oh wow , that is nice of you ! what kind ?"

long distance relationships are not easy . that is great news to hear . do you have anything special planned ?

that would drive me crazy . how are you handling it ?
yes i agree . i have boys and they are in their twenties . i do not know where the years went .
"i know exactly what you mean . i have been let down many times , and it is never a good feeling ."

that is so cool ! do you get to see her often ? have you ever gotten to see her in person before or did you meet online ?
why do you feel ashamed about the movie ?
why not ?
sounds like you had a good time . what pet is it ?
were you able to find them somewhere else
"i was too , but then i realized everyone was too and i made a lot of friends !"
going to the park is always nice
did they receive it ?
oh what happened ?
yes i agree ! do you think he ll help them win some games ?
did he get a beat down ?
does that bother you ?
i bet that will be fun
how d it go ?
how d it go ?
who was it for ?
"thats amazing , i love to travel . where are you going ?"
"oh no , did anyone notice"
"thats right , you have to stay faithful to the one you love ."
"sometimes when we re in a bad situation , we do things we would n t normally do ."
that is pretty impressive
sweet ! congratulations . was it difficult ?
aww that is sweet . did you get to have a party for him or anything ?
im sorry to hear that . what happened ?
"oh my , does she ever give it back . is it alot of money ?"
oh ive heard of that before . . scary stuff
do you feel like you interview well regularly ? were you qualified ?
have you gone out to try to meet people yet ? are you happy about our job ?
oh no ! i do not doubt it . diets make you so hungry and gives you crazy cravings for what you can not have . did it feel worth it or make you feel miserable ?
i have been there and done that . my vice used to be ice cream . then i learned about being high nutrient vegan and started to eat carbs again once i learned about nutrition . learning about nutrition made me start thinking about each thing i put in my body . like purposeful eating . it was a tough transition but i never went back . just do it for yourself and do not beat yourself up when you mess up . i know you can do it if i can !
i would have been upset too !
that is good . i always find interesting things whenever i go .
i am sorry to hear about your loss .
well that is a very mature decision of you . it is better than over spending .
how did you respond
"that is understandable , what did you do to pass the time ?"
she sounds like a sweety ! is she coming to gradution ?
that is a great delivery person
that is awesome . any big plans ?
why are you upset
sounds like a good day
payday is always my favorite day of the week ! do you plan to buy anything special ?
"that is great , what will you do when you first see her ?"
that is awful . why do people risk their lives and the lives of others just to get a tiny bit ahead in traffic to where there going . ridiculous . i am glad you were not hit .
why do you say that
it is nice that you love learning so much . what are you studying that you like that much ?
that is wonderful . i bet she is excited .
that is great ! what is the job
its hard to maintain that
did your dad love listening to elvis ?
oh no ! so what happened ?
that is great to hear . you must be so proud of them .
your parents sound like wonderful people !
"oh that sounds super scary , i hope everything comes back ok"
what mountains did you visit ?
its nice to have family
oh wow thats awesome
"oh , what is happening on friday ?"
you have to be prepared .
"i see , is that a good thing or bad thing for you ?"
loyalty is always good
congratulations ! hard work does pay off .
"that does sound tough , did it go well at least ?"
that is a really fun game . i wonder how they will make it better than the original .
that sounds awesome have you checked out the price for lessons ?
do not worry she ll come around and you are so right it is better for her to start by learning to play guitar first .
lol . was there any left when you woke up ?
that is what thanksgiving is all about lol
so that history can repeat itself ?
it happens to the best of us
hey you win some you lose some . what really matter is that you had fun watching .
oh i am sorry to hear that . you must be so worried .
that is so great to hear . nice to hear someone being happy with the important things in life and not always wanting more . its easy to miss things happening all around you if you are never happy with them .
what did he do ?
do they look rough or what
"it is been raining a lot here , too , i know that feeling ! did you manage to find something interesting to do inside instead ?"
i love a person of their word he is a great father keeping his word .
only water ? that is crazy lol
did she confess ?
i think we all feel you on that one !
that is very sweet
sucks that no one told you !
thats awesome . . how long has she been learning ?
yes that was an exciting moment for him and for the team as well !
"oh wow , that is so scary ! i would be worried for my family safety , maybe get a guard dog ? my dog always alerts me to sounds ."
"that is a good thing , right ? so the families can get the help they need ?"
what game are you waiting for ?
hey it is ok . we all do stupid things when we are young .
that is so great i love dogs they are so sweet and your best friend for life .
enjoy it while it lasts
oh no . was it really late ?
"oh , that is disappointing . what was wrong with it ?"
"that sounds horribly boring . you can always take this time to do some house work that you put off , so that it will be ready when your friends get back in town ."
what did you use the for ? something good hopefully !
you will have your day
oh no ! i have done that before . did you call them and ask for a grace period so you did not build fines ? we all make mistakes like that so do not beat yourself up .
was it any good ? frozen foods can be weird .
are you happy for them
i hate storms .
thats good . . seem like a good employee
"if you need to take time off , then i am sure your company will understand ."
that is great . summer classes can be tough . because its summer
haha that is a smart strategy . what kind of things do you like to buy ?
what was the lie ?
why do you say that
"aw , that is so sweet of you . doggos can be so rewarding ."
i do not doubt that you are feeling good about yourself ! are you getting the lump sum of monthly payments ?
thats good
why ?
are you able to afford one ?
you should to them before you do that
was the cake god ? sometimes you have to have your cake and eat it too haha .
ugh . that is the worst . have you called him her ?
"im sorry to hear that , whant happened ?"
do not worry about it . everybody messes up sometimes !
what was it
"that is great . congatulations ! ! ! ! did you get a big raise , too ?"
oh ok ! is that a bad thing or do you enjoy being single ?
oh yeah i know what you mean . have you tried dating ?
why is that
sorry to hear that . . what happened
i hate that for you
"oh wow , any special reason for him doing that ?"
that is always so fun to see everything that is gone on in your life . do you have a favorite moment that was captured in a picture ?
they grow up so fast ! how many kids do you have ?
that is too bad . you are not quitting are you ?
that is a pretty wild story . why do you think the aliens chose you in particular ?
"oh wow , that is a pretty scary movie . i would want company while watching it too ."
i get what you mean . some films just are not for some people . it takes some courage to watch .
"oh thats really nice , my friend in new york also has to do a test soon to get a promotion , i hope u get it u can do it ! ! !"
"i think that you are absolutely right ! thanksgiving is the best ! i love the food , and family . are your family coming to you , or are you going to the ?"
"that sucks , did you reschedule ?"
why would she do that
it was not dave ramsey was it ?
have you found it ?
that is terrible .
"oh , that is nerve racking . you have to be on guard . did they behave themselves ?"
that would be great would n t it ? they have it made !
i know that feeling . i have a husband and a boyfriend living here and it still feels empty .
it is nice to have generous friends . did you have something good ?
its nice to have a reliable person like that
"oh cool , what was it about ?"
did they have a good reason ?
"i am sorry , how important were they"
it is always nice to visit with friends you have n t seen in a while .
more money is always nice
did you have fun ?
that is great . i wish my daughter was determined like that .
i hear is the new !
there are some apps that allow a friend to follow your progress as you home . will that make you feel safer ?
whats it about ?
oh love ! i can only imagine the feelings you must be experiencing . do you have a good support system in place ?
"i am so glad you have people to lean on though obviously , your experience is yours and no one can know exactly how you are feeling . are you familiar with kris carr , with your interest in a plant based approach to diet ?"
"oh well , there is always next time"
"i am really glad to hear that ! what kind of job is it , if you do not mind me asking ?"
i bet that was disgusting ! i would bring a noseplug from now on .
that is really sweet of you . i hope your cat is doing better !
that does sound fun though
that is what pictures are for . are you guys ever going to live together ?
"the snails ? yikes . well , i have always thought it probably gets a worse rap than it actually should , and probably does not taste that bad . half of why i think it is probably gross is simply because they made it seem gross in old cartoons . so , how did it taste ?"
"oh man , i feel for you . kids grow up so fast . do you feel prepared for it ?"
that sucks ? did you see anything ?
i have never seen it . why do you like it ?
"that is great , so you enjoy looking after them ?"
"that happens sometimes . sometimes life just gets in the way . heck , sometimes you just decide you can not physically do a night out , and that is okay , too . i am sure they d understand no matter what . maybe you can make it up to them somehow ."
"i am sorry , i guess some friends just argue like that"
i love visiting breweries ! what is your favorite kind of beer ?
ohhh got ta hate that friend ! what do you drive ?
in what ways do you mean ?
"wow , congratulations to him ! he must have been studying very hard for his exams ."
"oh , dear . that sounds lonely . how are you holding up ?"
i know how you feel . i moved about hours away from my hometown for school and stayed for years and hated it . i moved back to my hometown and am so happy now . i am sorry you are having a tough time . have you gotten out and tried to meet people ?
that is a great friend ! i am happy you were able to see your family .
wow that is really frustrating .
"i do , too . we just need to take better care of the resources we have and plant more trees . do you do anything green ."
i am glad that he did . it is always good to stay hopeful .
i loved disneyland growing up ! did you go often ? how old were you and what was your favorite ride ?
that is awesome ! what a nice surprise . and congratulations on graduating . that is a big accomplishment . what did you graduate in ?
just try and teach them to be more careful with them
that is so nice of him to do . no one wants to help anyone out these days but i am glad for you .
i am so sorry to hear that ! cancer is such a horrible disease .
that is unfortunate . does she know that it happened ?
best of luck to you . the tension and nerves must be killing you !
i am sorry you have that . it must be rough
"wow , congratulations on getting a new job ! i think butterflies are good to have to make us do our best and it shows your job is important to you and you want to do a good job . what do you do ?"
"ah , that is rough . that was a very bold move on your part . but sometimes fortune favors the bold , as they say . i think you will be happy later on not having to wonder what if . still though , she could have maybe been more discrete about things ."
that is very nice of him .
sometimes that can be a good thing ? it is not always so bad !
i hate when those come around
"you should not feel bad , we all need alone time"
"oh wow , that is great ! only bad thing is he will be very busy with two jobs ."
there is nothing wrong with that at all . i have done it a few times before . nobody in the theater knows or cares that you are there alone .
where are you going
i am glad to hear something positive happened to you . were you able to do something fun or productive with the time off ? and what was the occasion ?
i would love to do that as well
"that is great ! it is hard to do that sometimes , especially on the weekends !"
oh yeah ? what kind of animal do you think it was ?
"oh no , what did they say to convince you ?"
that is a relief . did any coworker friends get laid off ?
maybe you can change that jealous energy into positive energy ! do some research into fitness and start a new journey .
"holy cow , that is terrible . i really feel for you . my dad had that happen to him and his dog when he was young , and he s told me about it as a warning to make sure i am safe with ours . i would n t wish it on anyone . i hope you get through the grieving process okay ."
"that is great , what did he give you ?"
oh no ! that is not good at all . it is hard to diagnose things sometimes
oh now that is exciting ! i moved two years ago and it was a very weird process . i was happy to have a new home but anxious at the same time .
"oh , i totally understand . it is frustrating when you feel like you are putting in the same effort or more ! and it works better for other people ."
"ah yes , does it bring back good memories ? nostalgia is a powerful thing ."
"that sure is embarrassing , did he get talked to about his behavior ?"
you should be proud . these are the moments you are never going to want to forget .
"your youthful vigor ? you think you are too old now ? you are only too old if you allow yourself to be . my girlfriend s year old grandfather was a full of life wwii vet who lit up the room when he came in . of course , you are not as physically active , but you have to learn to utilize your life in different ways ."
any plans for friday ?
i bet you were ! what kind of laptop was it ?
wowza ! that is impressive . i wonder how long until he s called up .
"i am really sorry to hear that . . . that is the worst scenario too , because you are parked and probably not even there , so you were completely powerless in the situation , and then you come back to your car to just have this bomb dropped on you . maybe there is something that can be worked out , since you just purchased it ."
i am so glad you got to visit with them ! i know how you feel to be far from family and home alone . take heart that you are loved by your family and friends even when they are not around .
that is quite scary ! are you able to see who it is ?
"wow , how long has he been juggling for ?"
sometimes you just have to concede defeat . i admire your resigned attitude .
"oh , no . i think i see where this is headed ."
congratulations on making a plan and sticking with it . what kind of diet are you doing ?
did it bite you !
that would really anger me as well . what did you do ? did you find the person who did it ?
i am happy for you ! everyone deserves to be excited about life .
"your family was being polite . if i did that my family would order a pizza , hah ."
"i did not even know they were making another , i loved the first !"
congratulation .
"wow , good luck . i hope it all goes well . it sounds like you are confident that it will . have you done one before ?"
really ? that is awesome . i used to watch reruns of that show all the time .
those poor dogs ! i hate puppy mills so much and unfortunately i live in an area where they are very common .
oooh i do not like owls . . . they creep me out
did you get to keep them ?
"that is awesome , did you ask your boss for one or was it unexpected ?"
"i hate that . that is one of my biggest pet peeves . that is such an awkward situation , because you do not want to come off as high maintenance and ask them to stop , but it d be so easy for them to have better manners , too . i wish i had better advice . maybe go to hr ?"
wow ! that is impressive ! you must be really prod of yourself !
"hey , honest mistake . obviously you did not come up with some dumb lie and make it seem like they made the mistake and not you . you owned up to it . i am sure they appreciate that more than you would figure ."
"yes dude the world is a trip , i made many friends over the years online and when i bump into them i make sure i go up to them and chit chat and shake hands , you never know when someone will pass away ,"
that is so unfair . i would complain very loudly if that happened to me !
stranger things is one of my favorite shows ! it stinks that the next season has been pushed to next summer though .
that is awesome ! he is such an amazing athlete ! any team that has him is lucky !
wow . . so am i . . i could not imagine doing that . its great that you are going to do it though
"oh , my dad use to play with those all the time when we were young and he d let us touch them !"
oh no ! i hate when that happens . . . hopefully your computers holds on a little longer for it to go back down
"wow , why are they still shooting off fireworks ? do not they know it is a one day holiday ?"
yea i hear that . . . it was much better back then
that is impressive . he must have been prepared well for the switch .
"wow , how exciting ! boy or girl ?"
yeah i am sure ! is this your first ?
wow that is such an awesome surprise !
where were you at ? why could not you go home ? sounds frustrating .
oh wow . . first time going to france ?
that sounds lonely . maybe you should try to hang out with some of your classmates ?
that is hilarious ! did you try to play it off like you meant to do that ?
it is always good to take the time to reflect on happy memories . i do that from time to time myself
"oh , man ! that is a nightmare ! was your boss upset with you ?"
that is great ! do you have any fun plans ?
whats wrong with your cat
that would make me mad . did you know who did it ?
time to look for one that deserves you
i am so sorry to hear that . what happened ?
"oh no , why are all the pets dying . it is so sad when that happens ."
i would have done the same ! i do not like snakes
that was very nice . why could not you have a baby shower ?
oh no ! inquiring minds want to know . . . is there plans for a second date ?
that is great ! how does that make you feel ?
who let him out ? did he run away ?
"oh , i am sorry to hear that . sometimes when you give up , someone good comes along"
that is awesome . your kiddo will be talking your ear off in no time .
"man , that sucks . are you going to go back and return it or did you eat it already ?"
that should have been scary ?
it mean that you are smart .
that is great ! i know that is an amazing feeling to have .
"ouch , i bet that must have hurt !"
that is unfortunate . did they reschedule the picnic ?
that is awesome ! how did it go ?
how did you find that out ? ultrasound or intuition ?
ah i have two girls too and remember the same old wive s tale haha . good luck on that boy !
thats awesome ! i hope the visit goes well
that is great ! good luck ! that attitude says a lot .
wow that is a bold move . how is he getting along with that ?
"that is great . i am a native spaker , but from what i understand english is very hard to actually learn"
"what kind of exam is it , and you sound confident you got this"
that is awesome ! you must have felt so proud of your achievements .
were you doing it in a public place ? weed can do that to someone .
that is too bad . have you given serious thought to trying to lose weight ?
that is so romantic . i also try to surprise my girlfriend occasionally with some little gifts
wow good for him . now he can drive you around .
wow im sorry to hear that . it sucks when something goes wrong at a job you ve been there long
do not you hate how customer service has no service anymore ? did you get the refund at least ?
what makes life so hard right now ?
why you do not want to join the comic book club ?
"oh , that is wonderful ! tell them congratulations for me ! you must be bursting with pride !"
"congrats ! time really does fly by , does not it ? what was your favorite moment from it all"
well studying is a good place to start . do you feel confident about how well you will do ?

"oh man , long distance is hard ."
so sorry to hear that . what happened ? is it something serious ?
hey bro . or sis . . . . . . you are talking to me now . . . . . hope it helps some .
did he get mad at you ?
"it is always good to go to places that make you feel younger again , it brings back good memories ."
that sounds fun ! what system do you play it on ? i have n t played mario kart since the wii .
that is wonderful ! i love those surprise visit occassions . sadly my parents would need to fly across the country to do that and it is just not feasible given my work schedule
eeeek ! i can not watch those anymore like i used to when i was a teenager . i bet you got scared ! those replay in my mind over and over .
what did you do ?
i am sorry . do you enjoy having the apartment to yourself ?
wow ! i am actually really jealous . how did that make you feel ?
what all did you buy ?
what even made you think about that ?
"dang , do not you hate when that happens . what did he promise you this time ?"
would you believe i have never seen a star wars movie ? do not hate me lol
"right ! ? one of the best shows of all time in my opinion , what are we suppose to do with our time ?"
that is nice . i bet he appreciated it .
are you enrolling into army ?
that is a big time in someone s life . do you feel ready for this new phase ?
how far away will you be ?
"oh man , that is a long way . do you have family visits planned so you have something to look forward to and help you get through ?"
oh wow ! what an accomplishment !
what kind of doctor will she be ?
"that is awesome , what kind of cat was it ?"
"im so excited for you , my friend has gone twice he said a lot of people are passed out drunk on the street , and even taco bell sells alcohol very weird place"
i just almost threw up a bit when you described it to me . so i understand
ugh i hate crap like that . why can not credit be shared ? does it always have to be so cutthroat ?
well all s well that ends well . i am sure glad they were able to see through such a cheap ploy .
holidays are a great time for family . i love that too .
what did they do this time ? kids are always getting into stuff .
"that is awesome ! it really pays not to burn bridges , you never know when someone from your past can help you out like that ."
"oh no , i can imagine how you must have felt when you realized . did you get sick ?"
that is not cool . i sure hope they fix their mess up quick !
that is terrible . was anyone hurt ?
you are lucky . that could have been really bad . did he stop ?
"that is a very stressful time in a person s life , but i am sure she ll adapt !"
does she have a good group of close friends ? maybe she s confident because of that .
i am glad you have a good plan for success this semester . did you pass last semester ?
that is awesome .
is the place nice ? have you seen it yet ?
oh no ! how did you and your family do ? was the house damaged ?
i can imagine you are nervous . what will you do ?
"i have never heard of silverfish , but if you have to hire an exterminator that sounds serious . i hope you are ok !"
s annoying
golf ? i could never get into it .
that is no good . what did he do ?
that is great . i can not wait to retire and travel
it is always good to start them young ! hopefully they love it and stick to it .
"omg that is so scary , especially if you took all your little ones with you that day"
it happens . maybe you should hide one somewhere in case you get locked out again .
that is awesome for your kid ! now she knows hard work pays off .
"wow , that sounds pretty special . are you his only child ?"
wow ! he houldl do competitions . i have only seen that on tv
i love cereal too . what type do your kids enjoy ?
"oh wow , how is it expiring already ?"
"always gamble in moderation , how much did you lose ? enough to get the hubby mad ?"
how did it feel ?
that is kind of rude for them not to invite you . you should tell them you were hurt .
true . i think the store should introduce some policies for punishing such individuals with fines
he sucks
why ? is there something wrong with the daycare ?
there is nothing wrong with that . unless you are mean
"wow , and you just walked out the store with them ?"
thats sad to hear . do you have any old pictures of it that you could look at ?
sorry to hear that . are you still locked out ?
why ? i will be your friend if you need friends .
really ? ? are you over protective of your kids ?
do not worry . ask some help from your friends and family .
how did it go ? was it his first sleep over ?
i have never had that . we do not have them here . good thing though lol
did you tell him anything ?
why was it sad ?
oh no ! why was it so bad ?
woohooo i bet you are super excited
"oh no ! can you find a different , less expensive dress ? or borrow one from a friend ?"
"friends sometimes have a sixth sense for that sort of thing , do not they ?"
congrats . enjoy it and keep yourself grateful . it is easy to take things for granted sometimes .
that is great ! sometimes it is kind of hard to save up money but it is good to have something saved up when things get bad
awesome ! i wish i was more productive sometimes . it would really make my life easier
"oh , i have been there ! i looked like a person who cut when i used to give a lot of cat baths ! did you clean it right away ? cat scratch fever"
no i have not ? i think it might be fun though . have you ?
is it a really good job ?
what do you mean by that ?
oh man ! i have been there . that is hard . i hope it was not too long !
do not you hate that when people do not tell you ? well now you know your co workers can not be trusted ! but maybe they were busy and just did not notice which is goo !
did they steal anything
i have been there ! is not it nice to feel secure even if for a little bit ?
i bet you were really excited .
pretty annoying jeez
good work . you must be feeling so healthy and fresh .
that is hard . was it a bad breakup ?
"oh my , was the surgery successful ?"
"that is sucks , you should quit if they do not appreciate you ."
you have a pet duck ? that is nuts !
it is hard ! maybe they are not right then . so many people are just not trustworthy . what have you tried ?
"which one ? was it good ? i have read a decent amount of those , but i am always looking for more ."
"what size pizza was it ? if it was a large , i am not sure how you did not get sick ."
"oh , that is fun to hear . what kind of class is it ? are you teaching , or a student , or what ?"
that is a whole lot of nutrition !
"oh no , i take it that you are not happy about it ?"
cool . everyonr needs a vacation . where are you going ?
the beach is a great place to relax as long as the weather is nice .
i bet you are excited
that is always nice when your hard work finally pays off .
how sweet . . have a great trip
"hunting , fishing and computers ."
that sounds really fun . are you going to go ?
oh ? that is pretty interesting ! how did it go ?
i know the feeling .
oh no ! well they have a lot of great deals online right now .
yes you should be fine . you can get two day shipping and get lots of cool stuff .
thats a sad thing to hear
i am glad ! tell me about it ?
how come ? is something wrong ?
i would love that ! give me that feeling
i have had to do this too with my best friends my beloved dogs . it is hard . i know how you feel because i have been there more times then i want to remember .
"well , it is almost the fact of life that irresponsible people will not last much and regret will be only consequence for them"
i feel the same way ! prices have already risen on a lot including for people selling things in certain states .
oh yeah ? it is always a bit suspicious when someone just changes their attitude like that .
"oh no , did you end up lading safley ."
did the snake try to strike at you ?
i am glad you did not get bit !
wow . what kind was it ?
my first time was scary too !
"i bet ! my sister is happy about that too , she has daughters ."
that sounds really interesting ! how do you like it so far ?
the other day someone flipped out on me all of a sudden .
did you get a good look at the guy ?
"i am sorry , i am sure you find one soon ."
she s lucky to have such a great kid .
"oh my goodness , me either !"
are you going to a univeristy ?
what are you studying to be ?
i bet it did !
that is understandable . i have to catch myself sometimes when my kids are in the car .
if people were just more considerate of the other people around them . . .
congrats ! how is it going ?
that seems very trivial but do you mean that he still does not seem to know you ?
"have you tried counseling , reading going through a program ? are there good things ? i know it is hard when a partner does not work on a relationship and keep it good"
cool . are you saving for something specific ?
what play are you doing ?
how many days are you looking for the extension ?
did she surprise you with it ?
wow i wish i could get my kids to do that . congrats
is that something they can do ?
"thats a good outlook to have ! what year are you on st , nd ?"
that is a little strange
used or new ?
did you already make plans ?
so what are you going to do ? reschedule ?
what were your plans ?
that is great . you must be an excellent parent !
sorry to hear that . . what happened ?
did you have a hard time in the class itself ?
what medical test and why do you think the result could not be good ?
did you take lots of pictures ?
congratulations ! i wish i could get a raise .
s it because they are getting bigger ?
did you get more or less ?
"wow , that is great ! you did a great thing by taking in a scared animal !"
"that is great ! make sure to always stay with her , cruise ships are huge"
i am really sorry to hear that what happened ? i am here for you if you wan na talk
"wow , you should be an avid shooter ! !"
"no way ! ! ! i hope you left the house ! ! i would , and probably would never come back"
why ? what happened ?
does she have valid reasons ?
wow ! i hate when things like that happen . i had a similar thing where they would have to replace the whole front body for a small scratch .
i sorry the hear that .
what have you tried doing to meet new people ?
how come ?
how old is she ? i havent experienced that yet with my daughter
have you talked to her about it yet ?
does she live on her own ?
"oh no , how did happen ?"
how so ? moneywise ?
that sounds like fun but i would be scared . i heard they are friendly tho . first time taking care of it ?
eww . that is disgusting
how did they put it there ? nevermind . its just too much
you need to write them down !
congradulations

what is wrong ?
hey that sounds exciting ! ! are you ready ?
yeah i would be pumped too ! is it coming with a raise as well ?
"do you feel negative about it , or positive ? it is hard to tell from your sentence . maybe you feel both ways . if i were in your shoes , i could see how you would start to feel some more pressure in that situation . i was always the youngest child , so i never had pressure on me to accomplish anything by a certain time . if you are not happy about it , hopefully you can turn it into a positive so that your sister does not get any undue negativity ."
"that seems like a short train ride compared to say , going across country or something ! are you going to be sleeping on it overnight ?"

i hate those things ! they are so restrictive . i wish i could remember the name of the medication that my friend is on that helped her . . . let me check with her and see if she texts me back .

"oh really , i was unaware of that ."
that is great . you have to buy a new one every so often as the motors get weak in them .
that sounds really dramatic ! what is the matter ? what is making you so unsure about it ?
i think it is an adjustment you have to work through . toddlers can really test anyone s patience !
"oh ! i hear you , i love them but i get sick when i eat them . did you do okay ?"
that is terrible ! sorry to hear that .
"well , sometimes we can feel that way in life . relieved because there is not drama , but get a bit lonely . maybe you can get out and meet some new people ?"

i am so so sorry to hear that .

oh yea something else insane ?
"o that sounds delicious , any idea what you will get ?"
"sadly , i agree with you . as i get older , it seems like that more and more . what happened that made you feel that way ?"
its so true ! i battle chronic illness and excruciating pain daily for almost years now not to mention drowning in old medical bills . i put my faith in god and pray for relief . its really hard to stay optimistic . i really hope life improves for you and you can enjoy and embrace life again .
i hear you ! it is sad yet happy to think of how great it was years ago ! i hope we get to keep our good memories when we leave this world

can not you just live with someone ?
that stinks . did you hurt your foot ?
"oh no ! its always tough in relationships but when you can not go see her or make her talk to you afterwards , i am sure its extra hard . did you call back and tell her that ?"
"hahaha . i am so sorry , but that made me laugh . i really do not mean to make you feel like i am thinking you are dumb , because i do not . everyone makes that mistake . i have an old honda civic , and i run into that problem , too . you probably gave the locksmith a good story to tell , and made his day . hopefully you can smile at it tomorrow ."
"oh , well , i guess that was a bit disappointing huh . well , maybe you can go real soon ."
i understand . tell me about it .
woo hoo ! what were you promoted too ?
"that is an interesting way to get attention . what spurred that on ? was it a dare , or was he just feeling wild ?"
do you guys fight often ? ? how do they usually turn out ?
"i am really sorry to hear that . what is worse is the best thing for breakups , the only thing that really helps , is time passing by . but the people who are hurting , in the moment , they can not really understand or accept that . so , you feel like you have to help and do something , when in reality it is probably best you do not smother them and that they have space . i hope she feels better , though ."
that is disappointing . did you confront them about it ? i am sorry you have to deal with that .
that sounds stressful ! how far did you move ?
"well , that is wonderful and i know it really is so great to hear your child s first words !"
that is always true . the saying goes . . water your own grass .
"yeah , i do . i am in a long distance relationship . i get that everytime i have to fly back home . i hope you start to feel better , though . loneliness can end up being a good motivator , however ."
"ah , your situation sounds complicated . i am sorry you have to deal with that . it sounds like you ve given a lot of thought though , and the way you lay it out , you sound very mature about it . you ve developed a good perspective on it , one that i should learn to appreciate myself . with your temperament , i am sure you will not suffer from loneliness very long . people will want to be around you , as long as you want them around you ."
do you feel their weight ?
are they usually a winning team ?
"wow , that must be scary to have to trust someone else with all of your stuff . what took you out of the country ?"
that is worrisome but also exciting . is it your first child ?
"that sucks , how old was the goldfish ?"
aw . i bet that is so bittersweet . do they graduate next may ?
what is the certification exam for ?
"i hear you ! life is so busy , never enough hours in the day !"
yes i do hate being all alone . that is how i feel when my boyfriend leaves town for work .
"right on , that sounds cool . did you go with family , or a date ? or maybe just hung out there alone ? that is okay , too . i love italian food , had always wanted to go to olive garden , but my dad hates italian . so when we were growing up , we just never went . now that i am on my own , i have been . . . twice . both times , they were just okay ."
i am sorry the hear that . maybe another company would appreciate your talent .
just take your time and do not get so nervous you got this .
that is ok . employers do not look at your grades i do not think .
yeah it should be a good one . who is your favorite team ?
that must have been somewhat weird .
that sounds so exciting get ready for sleepless nights and long nights gambling .
"i am sorry , but i do not envy you . . . i have always just driven a little sedan . i am an alright driver , but if i had to drive something bigger , i would be nervous , too . too easy for me to make mistakes . i kind of dread the day where i ll have to drive a big uhaul truck . i hope things go well for you , though ."
maybe you can observe what she s doing and use that to advance in the industry as well .
that does sound creepy . what did you do ?
oh that is pretty cool . were there any clowns there ?
did it turn out to be a great event even though the bands was unknown ?

wow . that is impressive ! i can not even do a cartwheel on a mat .
that
people really need to be more respectful . what did you do ?

"i agree , nothing like seeing them smile and have fun !"
"that is great , i do not pray often because i am not too religious . . ."

"sorry dude , thats rough . do you know why she did that ?"

it is important to spend time with your friends while you can !
"great , i bet he did a good job"
"i agree , people who do animal cruelty should be in jail ."
"wow , really , what was the result ?"
"oh no that is too bad , it was not your fault at least ."

oh really ? why do you think that is ?
yea i know how you feel
sorry to hear that . that must have been lonely .
did you return it ?
"oh my , were you rushed to the hospital ?"
really ? what happened afterwards ?
me too . its always fun during christmas
do not feel bad for the opportunity that you have . life is not set out on an even keel so we all must make the best of our lot .
"same , i can never go into public bathrooms for this exact reason . it is amazing how bad it smells in one of those !"
that is a slap in the face .
what job did you apply to then ?
so exciting ! what did you do with that money ?
really ! that must have bee so frustrating for you .
you always hope that is the case . sounds like it did not turn out well . i am sorry .
well good luck and i am sure you will .
i wish i was more like that .
oh really ? that must sting
you must have been disappointed . did you ask why you didnt get it ?
why are you nervous ?

you must have been disappointed in that ! was it an important class ?
that is so inspiring ! how did he do that ?
"i know what you mean , it is the excitement that keeps you up !"
i know right . did your mum ask you to see if you wanted it also ?
why ?
to whom did you give instructions ?
"excellent , you must feel proud of him as well !"
did you talk to her ?
i hate it when that happens . where you doing anything important when it happened ?
thats great you should feel proud
well done to you . not everyone has that type of focus . what where you studying for ?
have you had a lot of bad experiences ?
"oh my , i hope you were alright ?"
financing can be scary but a lot of places now have really great rates for auto loans .
i am not a fan either
sorry for that . i hate last minute cancellations . did he have a good reason ?
why ?
thats great is not it . i hate it when managers just boss you around and never listen .
i like secrets . did it turn out the way that you hoped it would .
you must have been rather surprised . did you thank her for it ?
what are you studying
you must have worked hard for it ! you deserve it then .
sorry to hear that . that is bad . what your manager did say about it ?
wow what a horrible thing to walk into !
any good emotions
"oh my , why was she arrested ?"
sounds like you may be choosing the same kind of person each time . there are good ones . if you give up now you may lose the chance to find the person who is right for you .
i understand how you feel
did you enjoy it ?
that is so sad
you must have thanked him for it ! what was the present ?
what kind of emotions
i miss those times too
i would had the same reaction . why did they fire you ?
i bet that was a nice feeling
was it good
what could go wrong when you are taking an exam ?
ugh dentist visits are the worst . atleast you can look forward to taking a break from work .
that is quite an investment . it must have made you feel good to be buying it with your own money .
is it related to your passion ?
oh so what did he speak about ?
that is gross
that sounds scary
"oh my , sorry to hear that . hopefully , you have a lot of good memories of her ."
"i am sorrry , was he okay ?"
that is good to hear ! he must have worked hard for it .
that is terrible . what did you do ?
"sometimes that happens , maybe you lost focus during ?"
did that make you proud
why did you lie to her ?
cool . you should look totally different ?
that does not sound good . you should speak to the police about this .
were you able to catch up with them on what is been going on in both your lives ?
that sounds stressful
is everything alright ? do they know what is wrong ?
you must be really anticipating that move ! what makes you think that ?
really ?
i am sorry that happened
that is bad . did she notice ?
good job ! did you inform the police about this ?
really ?
"what is transparent , may i ask ?"
did you end up having nightmares ?
"oh my , that must have been terrifying . is it gone now ?"
"wow , hope you had a blast and great time !"
where are you going
that is good news did you already take the written portion
what was it
that is rude of him . but i am sure he must have had a reason to do so .
that is good . do you feel grateful now that you feel relaxed ?
that sounds so awesome . i bet you worked hard .
that is a surprise where ou nervous to open it ?
"same here , i know how you feel buddy"

did he all get a s ?
how did it go
oh was it a nice house ?
oh no ! that is not good ! what is going on ?
congratulations ! i am sure you deserve it .
why are you nervous ? just try to be confident
i am sorry you were mad
did he come to pick you up ?
that is a good thing . a lot of people usually have to work on their weekends off instead of relaxing .
"oh my lord , how long to you think it had been there"
that sounds scary
hahahaha funny though . did he have something to do with it ?
what happened ? did someone scare you ?
are you excited for it ?
"what ? did , you have any idea beforehand , or he just showed up with your idea ."
really ?
"oh no , how long did he live ? is he still alive ?"
why were you late getting to work ?
it is always great to reconnect . sounds like it was lots of fun .
sounds like she did well

i hate spiders too
did you get it done
you were prepared for sure . did you get the grades yet ?
that sounds wonderful ! what are your plans ?
do not worry . why do you think it will cost higher ?
that is a good choice . what makes you want to join ?
we never are prepared for something like that . . how long ago was it ?
"i believe that , how did it happen ?"
that is so gross . i hope you told the manager and got a refund .
wow that is a nice surprise ! you must have done very ywell .
did you call the cops on them ?
unexpected is even better than expected ! congrats !

"that is sad , did they say why ?"
"oh , it is excellent ."

how old are you now ?
"yeah , i hear you . . i can see how that can invoke envy . . you will get there soon"
i have seen previews for it . looks exciting .
what did you eat ?
good for you . feels nice having school supplies squared away in advance .
did you speak to him about it ?
"let me guess , they are trying to overcharge you ?"
are you ok ?
you must be excited and proud all at the same time .
i have not been a fan the last few years but i am happy for you atleast ! lol any special tradition ?
is it something that you can go back and have added on ?
uhoh that sounds terrible . have they told you how long you might have to wait for ? that is no fun having to wait to hear news like that .
that is awesome ! what is it ?
sounds like fun but not for me ! im too scared of everything . did you have fun tho ?
that sounds exciting ! what sort of plans do you have for it ?
what kind is it ?
"well , now you will have some good television to watch ."
"ugh , i would have been so annoyed ."
i would have wanted to scream . did you have any time to drive through starbucks or anything ?
did you get a little baby crazy ?
"my sister is actually pregnant right now but , i am not supposed to know about that yet ."

how big of an advance was it ?
that is great . are you going to propose ?
for what ?

they can be difficult . what is the issue ?
yes it was ! i loved collecting the cards . they have pokemon go now
did you let her ?
are they older or younger ?
what did you say to them ?
thats awesome ! ! ! you will save a lot of money for sure .
i know how that feels
i do not blame you . it removes your sense of security and change can always bring out fear .
"well , water s water , so it should work out ok ."
i have n t been to a fair in so long .
mine started last week .
do you own a harley ?
you may want to think about not letting her borrow it anymore . sounds pretty rude to me .
what did you call for ?
what is wrong with your brakes
are you sure you did not get an offer but they are running behind ?
"ouch , that could be bad . what was her reason ?"
do you guys still work there ?
well that is sweet . i bet they love you
you should take a vacation ! that always helps me clear my mind .
"they did . i have struggled with trying to be more social , i think it makes life more fun ."
oh wow ! thats awesome . what type of car ?
that can be dangerous .
i could agree with this
that is awesome . what do you do ?
for a party ?

that is great to hear ! i love when people help each other
that has happened to me too . what did you do ?
aw . a little mice will not hurt you . it is more afraid of you then you are of it .
did it run after you ?
oh no . that had to be painful
i know how you feel . at least its not on youtube
did she not study enough ?
cool . have you found a place ?
that really stinks ! did you complain to him ?
that sucks . do you always try specific diets or do you sometimes just try to eat less ?
oh that is terrible . even worse that is in baby soap ?
thats great for them !
oh no ! that might be one of my worst fears ! could you sleep any more after ?
that sucks . i hate when friends move away . are you really good friends with them ?
that stinks why did you have to work late ?
i am sorry you are having trouble is there anyone you can talk to about it ?
i hear you . it is been super hot and humid here for weeks . the only time i get out of the house is to go to the pool or get groceries lol
is it more of verbal arguing or flat out physical fights ?
wow . what do they usually argue about ?
congratulations ! thats awesome !
"that is good , stress is so common in life so it is easy to become overwhelmed ."
that is very nice of you . we need more compassion in the world for sure .
"oh no , were you happy about not having to work ?"
"aw , that is nice . do you have a lot of good memories of high school ?"
"it happens to everyone , i stole too"
"i was devastated as well , he brought joy to all"
"oh , how did that go ? it sounds important ."
what sort of meat did they have ?
oh man . was it body odor like he has n t showered or something on him like smoke or animal stink ?
"holy moly ! i hate spiders . . . you should spray your house more , just in case !"
what is the square footage ?
consider yourself lucky
i would be upset too ! why would they do that ? did you try talking to teachers or principal ?
anyplace near you where you can get a cup ?
"nice . i have never had luck with being unprepared for things , i always choke ."
that is awful ! did you break up with him ?
?
"aww , that is so sweet of your co workers ! you are definitely appreciated there"
how many hours a day are you training
ewww ! that is gross . i actually made a toast for my son yesterday and when i was about to give it to him i noticed a little bit of mold on the side . i almost threw up
how do you think the interview went ?

"aw man . who has been working there longer , you or the co worker ?"
did you receive any sort of feedback as to why you might have been passed over ?
oh no ! that is unfortunate . . . did you guys reconcile ?
i think so . generally getting more or less than what you deserve to get is unbalanced .
im sorry ! are you going to be ok ?
yeah that is terrible . is you cat fixed ?
"oh no , that is bad what did you lie about ?"
"been there myself , the anticipation can really get to you . what kind of job is it ?"
could you explain why ?

"oh nice , i am sure that is quite a relief . where are you going ?"
that is awesome . have you been bowling for a long time ?
congrats ! how long have you been with your company ?
maybe is time for vacations ?
i am a very apolitical person .

i havent been a county fair in ages . did you make yourself sick eating junk food ?
how long has he been playing ?
i am really sorry to hear that . how long ago was that ?
that is good to hear . how long have you been married ?
"oh no , did you ask the restaurant if they have video ?"
that was rude . did you confront them ?
"wow , that is pretty early !"
"awww , i used to play sega with my brother it was awesome . streets of rage was my favorite game"
same . there is a lot of things i wish i could go back to for a while .
really ? maybe you should ask your boss for a raise .
"uau , that was a close call indeed ."
"that is interesting , why do you say that ?"
"yeah , i know how that goes ."
they do grow up quickly do not they ! but just think of all the wonderful new things he ll learn and friends he ll make . he ll be able to tell you all about it when he gets home !
"that is a definite plus . you will be able to have a little me time , which is also important ."
"that is great , on both counts . you must be so proud of them both ."
that sounds really annoying . have you said anything to them about it ?
that is very nice . did you feel better after that ?
"oh really , good for you !"
"yeah , i hate getting stuck in traffic ."
what ? ? ? ? that is terrible ! ! what a horrible person !
that is great ! congratulations . how much weight have you lost ?
"i agree . if you can not trust family , then who can you trust ?"
do not worry too much ! i am sure you will do great .
ugh that is so annoying . i try not to do that when i with my girlfriend .
that is awesome . sounds like you studied hard !
i am sorry . that must make you sad .

"oh jeez , did you ask him why he did that ?"
whoa ! i am sorry to hear that . did you want to kill the guy ?
i bet that was a nice surprise !
"nice ! that is an odd day to be paid , but good for you !"
did you feed it lately ?
losing a pet is a hard thing . was the cat old or sick ?
that is no good ! did it stain your clothes ?
"that sucks , did you mess up on some job activities ?"
did you eat something ?
i bet you are super excited for it . when are you going to be together
i pray he gets well soon . i had a similar experience so i know how it feels
congrats . you must be very proud of her .
when will you be going ?
what happened ?
did everything turn out alright .
that is great ! congratulations and well done . he must practice long and hard to get to that stage in the game .
"aw , well you can not win everything . be happy for her !"
thats a bummer ! i hope you guys can plan something together once the deadline is over !
did your car break down ? i always hate when unexpected things come up .
they always give a hour window and either show up late or not at all
"i am sorry to hear that , maybe you will get the next one !"
what is your favorite ice cream ?
oh no . did you at least get a severance ? were you able to get another job since ?
maybe find another adult with a kid for a play date
a new school year can be a pretty exciting thing . is it a new school year for you or your child ?
i understand i think that is a good thing .
time to get the spray out .
oh i bet . . thats always risky honestly . did you talk on the phone to someone while walking ?
"oh my gosh , what did you do ?"
oh how cool ! i bet you have a very beautiful voice . was there any prize ?

that was really nice of them . sorry to hear about your mother .
"wow , i bet that was a blast from the past ."
why ?
god for you . i am sure you are ready to ace that interview .
do you think that we are going to have another all over again ?
what kind of endeavor are you reffering to ?
sounds like a good time . what kind of truck is it ?
"oh wow , you bust be lucky ! i only see coins haha !"
sounds like fun . what kind of fishing did you do ? fly fishing ?
that is pretty nasty . have you confronted her about it ?
what ? ? that is so scary ! i am glad you are safe . that is why i always have my gun with me
that is great they were able to help you out . are you doing better now ?
it is truly horrible . such incidents mostly happen due to drivers being careless like texting while driving . i hope no deadly casualties had been involved in this event
good for you ! ! ! i think its annoying when people act like that about anything .
did you end up getting one ?
are you stressed out ?
"oh my , what is the matter ?"
try and give them another call to see what the situation is
oh ! what type ? a fun secret or one of those sadder ones ?
reasearching papers can be tiresome . did it turn out well ?
"that is awful , hopefully you can plan another one soon"
"oh no , i am so sorry . how long do you have to wait to take it again ?"
"uh oh , that is bad . did you have insurance for it ?"
i love vacation time . where are you planning on going ?
maybe just take it slow
what subject is it in ?
that is great for you !
that great news . i do not know how rare it is but in the years i have been married we have seen a lot of other couples suffer with infidelity .
i find faithfulness requires love and effort . both together are necessary .
"i love to hear that , positive stuff ! im glad for you ."
"im sorry to hear that . i think everyone feels that way to a certain degree , even if it is more for some and less for others ."
"yuck , that would be bad ."
are you planning to keep it ?
why is that ?
oh no ! are you alright ?
have you tried seeking expert help ?
"oh my goodness , that is crazy ! do you have home insurance to cover the cost to replace everything ?"
oh gosh ! are you alright ?
"dont be nervous , your instructors will not put you in danger"
"i did not know the exact timing like that , but it is believable and i know it is harder for the body to use the energy when you eat late ."
oh that sounds like a good deal ! it would n t get her in trouble or anything right ?
oh yeah ? when is your friend arriving ?
why are they so sad ?
did you study ?
well cool ! were you nervous at all going into it ?
why is it so annoying ? is your friend messaging you all the time or something ?

"how do you mean ? i guess it depends on the lady , does it not ?"
i am very sorry ! that is very frustrating ! can you speak with a supervisor about the situation ?
"oh , i bet that did irritate you ! it is bad enough moving , but you do not need your furniture falling apart on you ."
were you scared ?
"oh no , that is always really stressful . just do your best to prepare , and try not to worry about it . whatever happens , happens , and if you are less stressed you will probably do better ."
"ohh , gosh . what happened ?"

"you must be a good cookie chef ! do not feel too bad , they should have been quicker !"
"always great to see people youve been away from , happy early birthday !"
"for vacation ? and yeah , the rates are pretty high , hopefully you will not be in those areas ."
i grew up in miami so i know how you feel

that is intense ! what was it ?
did she take care of a bunch of dying kids ?
what school did you go to ?
why not ? how can you not be happy with a pack ?
thats insane ! ! were you able to get in ? and what concert ?
seriously . i was looking it up the other day thinking about moving somewhere else and that state was even worse . then to read about everything that makes the crime rate is overwhelmingly scary .
wow that is very far away . do you get to visit often ?
that happened to me once i almost died . my heart was racing and then boom out pops my cat .
what was the subject ?
that is good that you have something to protect yourself with
did they choose to switch themselves or was it out of their control ?
that is great ! sounds like he s a smart kid !
that would be good . there is so much vitriol happening in society these days .
who got in ?
"ok , who is competing you ?"
"aw , i am sorry , why can not you ?"
i grew up with hurricanes and those are terrifying i can imagine tornados
wow the trifecta ! congratulations on that !
i never liked those either . do you have any health problems that would make you dread it ?
do you at least get to ride in it with him ?
that is awesome . it is nice how social media can reconnect people .

oh no . that is horrible
"that is awesome , what did you do to take advantage of it ?"
wow that is interesting . did you win the case ?
"oh no , i am so sorry to hear about this , may his soul rest in peace"

that is wonderful ! that is a difficult instrument to master . was he nervous beforehand ?
oh no . is everything ok ?
did you ?
sounds like a productive evening ! what did you cook ?
"i do too , flying is kinda nervewracking"
why do you say that ?
that stinks but i guess the law is the law . are you going to fight it ?
what kind of practice is it ? that takes a lot of guts !
does it make you feel good to at least think about those times though ?
oh my god i am so sorry . i have only got one grandparent left and it is tough to even imagine not having her
that is always a wonderful feeling to be prepared and ready to go . are you a morning person ?
you should n t be jealous . there is no need for that
did you have to take a test ?
why did that happen
what happened
that is nice . is he enjoying retirement
do you feel like that helps or hinders your personal life ?
"how beautiful ! they are so much bigger when i see them than i think they are going to be . my parents house has some land and when i bring my kids over there , we can see the young bucks eating the grass in their backyard ."
that is amazing . children can amazing you if you give them the opportunity
why s that ?
that is very sad
get ready to wait for a long time . dmvs are terrible .
"well , that is fun ! i bet you are really excited about it ."
"oh no , i think i know where this is going . how did she manage as a waitress ?"
"haha oh boy ! well , on the bright side i am sure that is a mistake she ll only make once . we all have to learn ."
how have they changed the most ?
did you end up washing dishes .
a what ?
actually my aunt is afraid of them also . she said as a girl one cornered her and wanted to hurt her . why are you scared of them ?
im sorry about that . dont be nervous though . he is a loyal person i bet
were you worried at all about the cost of raising them ?
"nice , what team is that you are rooting for ?"
college ?
big plans ?
why is it torture ?
that must be pretty lonely . do you talk often ?
well that should help
how come ?
haha oh no .
i bet he appreciated that at least
sweet !
what kkind did you get ?
wow that is great ! how old is he ?
that is nice of you . is it a small dog or large ?
"why , what is happening on monday ?"
"that is good , are you married ?"
"that is a bummer , at least it did not go out in the beginning of summer , i guess ."
yeah it sucks when people just seem to have it all .
are you the type that is prone to getting sick ?
was there a reason why ?
oh no ! were they okay ?
oh no that is horrible . any idea why ?
you should find the local cafe or something
i used to get screwballs with my sister . those were our favorites as kids
how awesome . it is fun to remember the good old days
i hate when that happens
i have n t had pizza ht in forever . they do not deliver in my area

"ah , bummer"
i am sure you will do just fine !
"sorry to hear about that . is it still working alright , or under warranty ?"
do you feel better now ?
i am too
i can understand that . everything is right at your doorsteps .
that sounds terrible
did you take him to the vet ?
"little kids are pretty amazing how they can pick things like that up in the right environment . so nice you are teaching him good manners , those are in short supply in adults these days !"
what is it for ?
that is pretty cool . i am a pharmacy tech
that is so true . that certification was really easy . i was nervous for no reason
that must have been a nightmare . how many do you have ?
that can be rough . i know i have dealt with that with my kids by giving them each minutes of solo time before they go to bed . allows them to get their energy out .
where is he going and for how long ?
"wow , that is huge ! i wonder if he got sick afterward ?"
"i am sure you are , it is nice"
that is great . when did you take the test ?
congratulations ! what are you studying ?
i hate when that happens

oh that is a pickle . congrats on the new love . why might your parent not approve ?
"that is great , i hope he enjoy his her stay"

perhaps some vino with it ?
yeah i know how that feels . i think it is part of growing up .
i believe in that too .
christmas ?
"oh no , what for ?"
i can imagine ! what did you have on the pizza ?
i hear you ! have you tried spraying lemon etc on yourself or eating them ? helps me a lot !
i hope it turns out well for you
"good , were you always late ?"
i can understand the feeling . what job did he get ?
i think the right amount of spanking is ok . i was spanked as a child and know i deserved it . hopefully you did not take it to far though !
"i still have yet to see it . i hate how hype affects things . i wish you could always get to things before they become really pumped up . i bet if you watch again sometime later , you will find it a little better ."
"i get it , i think i would like to go back and relive the big events . i miss those the most , football games and dances ."
"my girlfriend always likes to wait until the needle is past empty . i never let it get past half way empty . i do not get how she deals with that stress in her life ! and to me , it makes no sense . but i guess she hates spending the money on it , so she waits ."
well that is nice of you to do that for them . i bet they enjoy the treat .
they might ve taken out a loan they can not afford .
what is that ? drink ?
oh that sounds awful . i am sorry you had to see that .
"i would be too , i never win those things !"
"yes , i am sure it makes you anxious . but , no sense in worrying !"
"cheer up buddy , it is all in the mind"
by being a decent person . . . i am not a cheater and could never . . i am very monogomous . . why would you get married if you wanted that ?
what happened ?
that is great . how long was he gone ?
that is a good feeling
i bet ! i am glad you have a good relationship with a sibling ! that is rarer nowadays
"that is terrible , i am sorry to hear that ."
"i love shrimp nachos , but any nachos are good really"
"wow , that is really extreme . you should feel bad about it ."
how cool is this ? i won free ice cream for a year from my local creamery !
"i can understand that ! i actually attempted a diet about a month ago , and it was miserable . what made you give it up ?"
did you roll down your window and yell at him ?
oh really ? is that your favorite month ?
i love pizza
its hard to find people to help move .

"that is nice , the ones i use play the same songs over and over !"

i would be mad too ! do you have any idea who could have stolen it ?

the entitlement everywhere is terrible ! did you find out who did it ?
did you call the cops ?
oh ! mine broke too this past weekend but i got a new one as it was just a cheap dirt devil . i am glad yours is fixed !
oh man does not that just make you want to take a car and run right . . . . . just kidding . . but yeah that would make my blood boil

"that was really nice of them , they are good co workers"

"oh man , i forgot about cracker jacks . i always looked for the prize"
"oh no , that must have ruined the round !"
i am hoping as well

thats understandable ! just be yourself and im sure you will do great !
"oh no , that classic prank ! i bet that was painful , i have only seen it on movies ."
"cheer up buddy , everyone have experienced that at one point or the other"
"for a test ? it is good that your confident , that is key !"
oh that is good ! any special reason ?
"making new friends can be tough , is there anyone at work you bond with ?"

i am so sorry for your loss . how was was he ?
were you scared
it is not good to be jealous of your friends .
gee that is sucks . have you tried contacting them ?

why are you hesitant
yes and staying away from addicts is always good as well ! pick a different hobby for sure that is healthy is good !
what game was it ?
that was nice of them
it is good to find some time for ourself to rest .
"that is really rude of them , i guess no one taught them manners ."
that is very sweet to even reach that age and to retire ! i hope he gets to do fun things now ?
it has been long
i agree . i put a lot of effort into my work and i hate when things are half done .
wow thats super exciting . i hope you do too . what would you go for ?
"that is very nice of her , not too many left that would offer to do that for a stranger ."
"oh no ! im sorry , i have been there before too many times . just know everything happens for a reason"

"so , the women only like you because you have money ?"

"yeah , i would n t get too down . statistically , there is not much of a chance of ever winning ."
it is good to always try and think positive .

getting out of work is the greatest feeling .

i have always wanted one of those ! they are very charming .
what is his name ?
wow that sucks ! what kind of diet is she on ?
oh my thats good ! where did you loose it ?
are you nervous about it ?
that is too bad . that sounds lonely .
oh no ! that is not good . what did you do ?
nice ! what book were you reading ?
really ? i use fans as well ! most cities have a noise law for after . . you can call and see ? poor dogs should n t be out late anyway
i hate that feeling ! do you have that happen often ? i feel you . i have been losing sleep every night recently . are you in front of blue light computer screens or phones a lot ?
"i understand how you feel , my mom and dad love our older brother a lot and they do not even hide it hes the first born"
"oh my lord , are you okay ?"
"oh boy , that is amazing ! congratulations , you certainly deserve it"
that is great ! i love it when something like that is completely under control .
i do not blame you ! do you normally let him drive your car ? does he just take it without asking a lot ?
schools are fun . i wish i could turn time back and go back to those good old days
hahah did it make you a little jelous you think ?
did it work out or still waiting to hear back ?
that would be ! however i am not a big fan of theme parks . i do like vacations though ! maybe you can go next year ?
that is not good have you tried calling them to talk about the problem
"oh , that sucks . it has happened to me before too ."
"i am sorry for how she treated you . even if she could not refund the money , she could have been more polite . maybe you could talk to someone else and try to download it again so that you at least have the software ."
do you mean you feel bad that you do not get to go through bad things or that you do not get to be healed ?
what sort of diet are you on ?
yeah i really dont like most call centers they never talk to you in a happy manner they always give me an attitude
why what did they do to betray your trust ?
i would be so mad i dislike when company s charge my card did you call to get a refund for the charge ?
"oh , tell me about it , please !"
"that is not good i am really sorry to hear that , is he o ?"
oh nice . what movie did you see ?

"that sounds like fun , what band is playing ."
what was it that gave you problems ?

i am really happy that he made it . i bet it was a tough thing to go through .
yea that would n t of turn out great .
that is nice that you have someone you can trust like that .
"oh man , that sounds like a pain ."

yuck . at least it wasnt in your house . that is gross .
that must have brought back a lot of memories
"that is great ! i need to start saving money , myself ."
"poor dog , did he survive the impact ?"
is it because you are there for him ?
oh no . what is wrong ?
vacations are the best . where are you going ?
did you have any damage ?
that has got to feel good ! did you get a raise or a new job ?
anticipation sucks . the hints do not help you figure it out ?
"these places should have them clean , because it is inevitably these things happen"
you must be so proud . im sure she put in a lot of work to learn .
what concert is it ?
that sounds like a great memory ! i always get nostalgic about pretty much everything . how long ago was it ?
so peaceful and relaxing right ? what a beautiful sight .
oh that is great . is she going to collge ?
oh i hate people like that . people that flake out like that just have no respect for anyone elses time .
"uhoh , i hope they dont have a late fee or anything attached to it"
"sorry to hear that , try and keep busy or find a hobby eventually you will get over it , its just gon na take a bit of time"
whoa . that is a big change . that must make you so happy .
that is great when you have good maintence for a place .
awesome ! congratulation . so you are enjoying the job now ?
i have felt that . it always sucks feeling like you can
like ever before .
and what happened next ?
wow i would say the same ! accidents happen but come on pick them up . im sorry !
wow how unappreciative they sound . you will be better off at your next job i am sure .
i bet . it can be intimidating to start a new regime .
"i should start back to working out . the older i get , the harder it seems to begin . do you have any advice ?"
"lol , that would be awesome to get some free childcare . my kids tend to drive me nuts at times ."
how long ago has this been ?
does that happen often ?
very cool of you to take a stand on something you believe in .
! i have never won that much !
how did that end ?
wow thats a long time to work together did yall meet at work ?

her loss i am glad you did not get too stressed about therejection
"i have never seen that movie , why is it depressing ?"
"now thats more depressing , cheer up you eventually find better friends"

were you able to find out what it was ?
were you expecting them ?
i know i hear you . . . maybe one day we will win the lotto .

what happened today ?
being helpless when waiting for things is the worst feeling . there is nothing you can do but you need to do something !
"your an outstanding mate and great friend , she must have had a hard time my child hood friend died in a car crash and i felt dead inside for a long time"
thats so sad ! im really sorry . have you been researching about it ?
did she break anything ? how old is she ?
"i agree , it is good to have something to look forward to ."
what happened ?
that is good to hear . is there any chance of promotion in the future .
that is annoying . i wish public transportation was better in the city .
what was it ? i am a music lover .
thats terrible to hear . . . when did you find that out ?

"oh no , why do you think like that . . all should be good"
"i am sure you did great , do you have doubts that you did not ?"
that must be pretty frustrating
oh really ? what did they do ?
how did you hurt it ?
that is ridiculous ! that is annoying when people do not clean up after their dogs ! i love going to the local park with my son and there is dog poop in the grassy areas
you should ve called the police if they did not listen to you
has it been a long time ?
i would have been feeling the same way too . oh well maybe she thought it was cute .
"that is great , do they enjoy it ?"
oh no . i bet he felt really bad about it .
congrats ! how is it going ?
"that is great , how did you repay her ?"
a surprise party that is awesome did you have fun ?
"well thats part of being in the workforce , work when everyone is looking , hang out when they are not . most people arent paid enough to care"
i could imagine . its a big day you both waited so long for .
old memories are the best . do you plan to go back again soon ?
thats so impressive ! you must be proud .
"awesome , you saved yourself a ton of money by doing that !"

"yeah , i am taking care of her for the last few months ."

"haha , you could have played it off as cute and clumsy and maybe they would have been into it"
what do you have coming up ? ill keep you in mind .
what was it that you did to feel so courageous ? ?

that is great ! what kind of project is it ?
it is frustrating to watch i agre
were they your children ?
what kind do you have at the moment
"good for you , as an added bonus you are saving more money !"
at least you finally got one ! sometimes it helps not to focus too much on what everyone has has or has done .
"oh no , do you have a digital backup ?"
that is pretty messed up . why did you do that ?
"that is awesome , what will you spend it on ?"
there is no right place to be for everyone . each person has their own individual path
"oh really , what happened ?"
i have never seen it
"aw , i really sorry to hear that . is is serious ?"
that really sucks that that happened to you . maybe start by putting small amounts of trust in people
nice what kind of project was it

i know how you feel ! i am about to be and i feel so old lol

"that is awesome , congrats ! do you have a job lined up for when you finish ?"
"wow , that is a pretty cool hobby . just a small plane ?"
"haha , i have seen plenty do wheelies . i have seen a few crash too , sadly"
that is great ! do not be too nervous ! your date is most likely just as nervous as you are !
yeah they are great . super light and rigid . they feel kind of springy when you ride them
absolutely . it does not help that i am pretty introverted .
"why do you feel bad ? it is a tough decision for sure , but you should never have to feel bad about it ."
blessing are another reason to be grateful !
that is really generous of her . she ll grow up to have pretty good karma
oh man ! that is some jerry springer level drama . what happened ? did you tell him
"oh man , that must have been humiliating ! did people notice ?"
"congrats ! how did you do it , and where do you work ?"
everything is harder until we do it . and am proud of you for donating blood . it is one of the good habit of this human race i would say .
"you met johnny dep ? i have no idea , what happened ?"
do you think they just did not want to pay for your retirement ?
wow that is cool . . . with hers or your credit card . . ?

"that is impressive but , mags are rare . are you sure it was not a magnum ?"

i am sorry . that must be difficult . i am glad you have pictures to hold on to though .
oh nice ! hope you get it
that is absolutely amazing ! i am so proud of you ! you should be very proud of yourself as well
"oh no , what happened , whats the problem with the provider"
"sometimes that happens when you take a break from something for too long , but with some practice you might be able to pick it back up again"
"absolutely ! i have always noticed that phenomena . if you act too desperate it actually puts them off . on the contrary , acting a little disinterested gets them more interested ."
that is cool . i ll have to try those out sometime
its always a great time when that happens . my best friend and i moved away so i hadly ever see them now
oh yes ! deja vu has happened to me quite a bit ! it is eerie and cool huh ?
he probably passed the infection to his mouth ! gross !
"oh awesome ! that is crazy , because my th birthday is next week , lol . what makes you excited ? because i am dreading mine ."
i have always wanted one of those ! i hope you enjoy it .
that would make me so mad ! what did you do ?
"im glad you made changes for the positive in your life . you cant go back into the past , but you can keep moving forward"
why do you think you will get fired
please let this one work ! .
"oh sweet , i can not even imagine the excitement you must have . i hope everything works out for you !"
more than a couple of times .
i would never go to that place again . did you go to a different place ?
i get you . i hate fighting but i am not going to be disrespected either .
hm i can relate to that haha
that must have been really annoying . sucks to be a person who s on time dealing with people who do not care about being on time themselves .
as long as it takes you from a to b and safe to drive that is all that matters i used to have camry and it looked old and beat up but it was the best car i have had
she spend all youre retirement money ? that is pretty messed up . why did she do that ?
are you going to divorce her ?
are you going to the police ?
oh i hope you can find an alternative
sounds like you will be alright after all
i am sorry . how long had you been together ?
"oh no , is she on computer too much ?"
"ooh , awesome ! i bet everyone s excited ! i hope the future holds many more wonderful things for you !"
have you gone on dates before ?
i still think you made the right choice by going .
i am so sorry . that is heartbreaking .
"whoa , did it stink ? was it roadkill ?"
what is making you have second thoughts ?
"as we say around here , you ai n t lying ! how long were you waiting ?"
wow ! did you thank your mom or buy her any gifts on your trip ?
"wow , i bet that was nostalgic . how d it feel seeing your old self doing fun stuff ?"
that is great . you must be excited . have you played all the smash bros games ?
"that is pretty cool . i have never played it before , what genre is it ?"
that sounds fun i might have to check it out . it sounds pretty nostalgic .
i understand where you are coming from . can you blame her for window shopping though ?
that is awesome . you must be excited . i have been to cancun but not cozumel .
i would hate to live by myself . i have been married years and have kids and grandkids . i do not know what it is like to be alone .
"oh gosh ! that is terrible . i stayed in a house with a rat problem for a while , it was not fun . what re you going to do about them ?"
yes all the time ! that sounds like a nice dream . do you still have a close relationship with your family ?
oh my gosh that is terrifying ! what kind of snake was it ? and what did you do ?
"i have , do you have any"
i do not think i could work in a daycare . it would be overwhelming .
some people are just better at working with kids .
that is the worst .
lol . all men do for that matter
"wow , what a surprise !"
"it is indeed , learning things at young age is a boon . you got an exceptional daughter"
oh no . did you try to retrace your steps to find it ?
oh that stinks . did you have phone insurance at least ?
i am so sorry . hopefully there is something they can do for you
i know where this is going lol
so it was not a kitten ?
what was it ?
that sounds like fun ! it is great to spend time with our children . did you have fun ?
i bet it was ! i have two kids but they are pretty young . i am looking forward to seeing them achieve the same thing .
"oh man , that is the worst ! all that hard work , ruined"
i have never heard of that
i bet . what grades are they in ?
that is really frustrating . what band was it a t shirt for ?
"i used to go fishing with my grandpa a lot as a kid , brings back awesome memories"
that is a good feeling
oh dang ! did you file for classes late ?
that is my favorite part of facebook ! especially when i see old pics of my kids .
"about this time of year , there is a lot of first day of school pics ."
"and in between football games and soccer games , and christmases it is a healthy reminder that time flies so quickly !"
oh that is awesome ! im sure you do ! waiting for that can really feel like forever when its only been a few minutes !
haha ! i am only laughing because i know exactly what you are talking about ! that has happened to me a couple times ! . i had to use a hand towel once !
why s that ?
thats good ! relationships are not for everyone all the time . you have to love yourself before you can love someone else right ?
thats no good
that is good . your interview must have went really well .
thats good . its very important to instill good learning and study habbits . something i wish i had as kid
that is good to hear . i am glad you did not overspend and go into debt .
i love self gifts . what was it
really ? is it a good show ? i have never heard of it .
i do sometimes too
"uh oh , hopefully there is something you can do about that !"
i have never gotten a ticket lol
a lot of people are . money sense does not come natural to all people .
"that is kinda cool though right ? some people , like my mom , could not wait to get us out"
paid lunches ? like a cafeteria ?
why is that ? did you have a bad experience as a kid ?
you should do it .
you will be really happy when you get paid
did that happen intentionally ?
what causes you to think that way ?
"nods , understanding i remember that feeling with my oldest . she had n t been around too many other people besides her dad , me , and a cousin or two . there was an open house at the school she was going to and all of us went to meet her teacher and get a feel for her classroom . is there something similar at your son s school ?"
"hmmm . . . i think once he gets a feel for things and engages in activities and just busies himself he might be okay with it . just reassure him that you will be back at the end of the day , and that you can do something special at home when he s done with school ."
i think i remember that movie
have you complained ?
dr mario is that game for me
how do you feel about that ?
i hope she is worthy of that trust

"well , you can not do everything ."
"that is smart , money is tight these days"
everyone has bad bosses . just keep working hard and they will have to recognize your greatness .

"i have been there , i hope everything works out for you !"

"do not worry too much about it , worrying can actually make you preform worse . you can always retake the test !"
"wow , then you know how it feels . i hope you do great ."
"oh no ! i have never seen that movie , but it sounds like it was very horrifying ! have you watched it as an adult ?"
"wow , that is sleazy , what did you do ?"

do you think you might get it ?
how did it go than ?

i think it is time to call the animal protection unit
what job did you apply for ?

"i am not married , so i am not sure ."

"oh no , i am sorry to hear that"
"oh no , is your dog okay ?"
did he catch you
i bet that must have taken you back to the good old days ?
glad to hear it . did you get to relax at home ?
oh no ! ! did she find out about it ?
that is so sad . did you comfort him ?
ah ! that must be so frustrating . you should speak to him about this .
"that is terrible , what did you do ?"
thats gross
why were you scared ?
that is so cool . you are so lucky to have been able to experience that .
nothing like mom s cooking !
that must so inconvenient ! are you having trouble falling asleep because of it ?

"i am sorry , i hope you find it ."
"congratulations , you will be spending time with your loved one again"

oh really ? how d you find out ?
"i love cats , they are the best ."
i can understand
wow ! that is amazing ! i would love it if my parents got me gifts like that ! !
"that is good , its very important to have an instructor like that to calm your nerves ."
"oh man , where customers upset with you ?"
i hate when that happens but that is good they were quick to replace it .
oh did he pass ?
did you look all over for them ?
"oh my goodness , that sounds absolutely terrifying . do you think they would ve hurt you if they found you ?"
that is a unique experience to go through . does she have a nice location picked out for it ?

"oh , what is it ?"
oh no what did she say ?
you must be so proud . that really is a great accomplishment that he has made . is he going to college ?
was it an expensive one ?
oh no ! that is so scary
"yeah , you can really get in major trouble for doing that ."
i am sorry to hear that . do you know why your neighbor does that to you ?
who does she talk to on the phone regularly ?
i can imagine that would be a painful waiting period . why do you belive she is unfaithful ?
i can see the why you would feel that way . i would be worried too .
the good news is the chances of actually getting hiv is relatively low . you should not have to worry about it .
"oh no , did it not turn out the way you planned ?"
do not be so negative about it . maybe you will really like the person .
that is very good of you . i would be proud of myself if i can do such a thing especially if there is a huge chunk of money in it
that is great ! what kind of car did you get ?
"oh no , what are going to do ?"
i hate when they forget the cheese
that is nice to gave a friend that can help you in time of need .
sounds pretty incompetent to me . have you found a new one yet ?
congrats ! it is great to pass your test . though staying up all night to study may not be the best studying technique .
haha that is funny !
that must be quite nostalgic .
is it a newer model ?
i am sorry to hear that . it is really horrible when a friend backs out at the last second .
"wow , what a forward woman ."
lol . . . thats harsh ! are you ?
that is great you have that kind of confidence .
"first of all my condolences for your friend , and i know how hard this is for you both"
"ya it feels so weak to be in that place , but you should only give the strength required for your friend to overcome this situation"
that is awful ! maybe you can pay them back ?
that is bad . i hope you will find something interesting to do .
oh yea ? why is that ?
"oh no , im sorry to hear that"
that sounds so disgusting !
why she want to divorce ? did she tell you ?
"yikes , did you miss a payment ?"
i am sure you are beautiful too !
wow ! i can imagine how joyous that feeling must have been !
"oh , no that is not good . im sorry"
i hope all goes well . was something the matter that made you decide to have the tests done ?
oh no i am so sorry ! i bet that must have been scary too
i love pizza . what style pizza does the place make ?
uhoh i hope you did not get in trouble ?
that is terrible . what did you do ?
"that is great , trust is the backbone of all lasting relationships ."
that is bad . did you go to a doctor ?
i do too . it always brings back so many good memories .
i am sorry to hear that . thieves are really crappy people .
oh wow ! are you okay ?
oh why is that ? do you play ?
"good for him ! that is a very valuable skill to have , good on you for teaching him so early ."
oh i know that feeling actually . . . did you ever make up with your friend ?
"that sounds like fun , what kind of movie will you see ?"
"i love eating there , the food is always amazing ."
i hope it was not a close friend that lied .
that is sad . liars and thieves are just the worst .
"that is embarrassing , but also funny . how did your date react ?"
why ?
aww what did you end up doing instead ?
"oh no , are they going to be okay ?"
"oh my , i hope she is ok ?"
wow . it is very unsual to see that .
that is so sweet of your child .
that is annoying ! did you end up eating it anyway ?
"wow , what is the special occasion ?"
aww was it your birthday or something ?
"i bet , its always nice to get a chance to work with someone you really like . where do you work ?"
you must be very proud of your new set of teeth
what preferences do you mean ? you should n t have to say your truth to anyone .
congratulations ! when is the wedding ?
oh no ! that is so sad for you . how embarrassing .
oh no ! did you manage to avoid a stain ?
how did it went ?
"oh god that sounds terrible ! are you okay , is everyone in your house okay ? did anyone get hurt ?"
i am sorry that happened . do you still have contact with him ?
"that is horrible ! do you think it is really true , or she was trying to just make you angry ?"
are you worried and nervous ?
that is terrible .
sorry to hear that . is the feeling mutual ?
"oh my lord , i would have been terrified . are you okay ?"
i feel you ! summer is great and all but i miss my classmates and the work i am studying .
how did you do ?
oh . i hope you get it !
oh no ! what happened ?
are you ?
how fun ! how did you all celebrate ?
"yeah , i remember mine as well . they were always a great time ."
wow ! congrats ! was it hard contest ?
nice ! what kind of car is it
"oh goodness , that is terrible ."
omg ! how nasty !
i am sorry that happened . maybe she was tired from working all day .
i have never had greek cuisine
"that is great , she will fit right in !"
what are union memners points ?
sounds fun ! what movie are you going to watch ?
nervous ? that is interesting . has anything changed recently ? what are your thoughts on why it is happening ?
"that was rough , how long ago was this ?"
"that is pretty nice . i am in college , and i have had three different roommates so far , having to move three different times . starting to get old . you truly lucked out !"
that is too bad . what are you going to do ? was this your first time gambling ?
"it is nice that you tried to comfort him . i am worried about my parents , also . it is hard to be worried about something like that in your family , knowing that you have no control over whether or not it will happen . it is sad ."
"i feel for you . my girlfriend is in the same position . luckily we do not have kids to complicate things , but her job wears her out and it does not seem like she can physically or mentally keep up with it . kids just make it so that you feel you have to do it until you die , no matter what ."
what did he do ?
omg i was about to say that is so mean and rude and i would be so embarrassed but i know it was a honest mistake i dislike the auto correct .
what happens on saturday ?
i think it is about time you lay down some rules !
oh my yeah i would have been pretty irritated !
nice ! six months is a long time to be car less . i am sure you have a new sense of freedom to do what you want and need to do while he s at work now .
well that still makes you a great friend !
that is cool . what type of supplements
have you had trouble lately ?
oh really ? i hate winter though ! i do not want that to arrive
it is nice that you have a meaningful item from her . it is a pretty bittersweet feeling thinking about someone you loved who is gone .
that would take such toll one me . just make sure they have enough to keep them occupied maybe .
that is awesome ! it is always pleasant to have a good day .
"oh , i hate it when that happens have you looked on places like mercari or ebay ?"
i find this context hard to believe .
are you a cop yourself
well that is kind of you . they must really be going through something .
oh god ! i would be so ticked ! do they have cameras ?
oh man that sounds horrible . i would probably faint .
"thats amazing , i am sorry for your loss , but atleast you have a constant reminder of him ."
"oh no ! , did you ever end finishing it up in time ?"
oh no that is terrible ! are you going to apply again ?
woow . that is terrifying . are you alright ? do you live in some rural areas ?
"yes , that always saddens me too . i see them now and then ."
good for you . being honest is important .
the note is for what ?
what country ? if you do not mind sharing . . . i am in south texas and loving it
wow she must really fancy you . you should ask her how she found you .
oh that is so gross ! i hate bugs too !
"wow , so close to graduation ! what does he want to do after he graduates ?"
budget for what ?
what ?
mistakes happen ! i am sure people are not too upset . i have numb hands so i drop things all the time
feeling a bit scared about the weekend .
"i have a hard time with my anxiety sometimes and i will be alone a lot this weekend . i do not like free time , i like to stay busy so i do not think much ."
"that is annoying . so , does it still work and it is just hard to use , or does it just do nothing in general ? deals are always tricky like that , as sometimes they are too good to be true ."
that is just sad of a dad to be that way . kids need a lot of unconditional love . . but parents are not always perfect and sometimes do not know how to love their kids like they should !
oh gross ! they should have street cleaners taking care of that . poor animal .
i bet you are proud !
i agree . i used to be a deadbeat but now my life is dope . are you talking about a friend or family member
"definitely not a sucker ! if she helped you a lot and you would n t be here without her , then yes ! why did she block you ? were you bad to her ? sounds familiar to what has happened between me and a few . . . i was there for them but had enough and i have had to cuit them out too"
"that is always a weird situation . you are excited about the offer , and you are worried that if you turn it down that you might not be able to find anything else , or as good . but you also do not want to be tied down to a bad place . what were some of the red flags , if you do not mind me asking ?"
that is tough . i would just make sure everything is nice and clean around the house so she can just unwind . maybe make a nice dinner and do the dishes after .
anywhere else ? lol you do not have a lot of thai places in town ?
that sounds like a fine day to me . do you have many birds ?
oh no ! i am so sorry turtles need a lot of care to thrive
what happened to the first one ?
i am sure it will be fine . did you buy a good brand ?
"so sorry , you never really can tell with these things can you ?"
me too . i cant take this heat anymore . it is so muggy outside . its so annoying .
is there anything like free cash ?
oh nice . what type of presentation
that is awesome ! any new changes lately ?
can you have it repaired ?
i am so sorry . i know that must be a difficult time .
that should be fun . where does the cruise go to ?
they really do make you stronger dont they . it may not seem like it right away though .
good luck ! hope you do well
"wow , that is grate . are you also a musician ?"
that makes you a queen .
wow ! that would be an awesome surprise to come home to !
oh you did ? what kind of job ?
that is great ! how can you tell you are on the right path ?
"that is good , i hope nothing went wrong"
i hope it works out for you then .
"wow , that would be a huge accomplishment if you did it !"
that is great . she sounds like a passionate and independent woman .
that was nice of him . what was it ?
what kind of weather is that ?
what kind of fun did you remember having there
he should be fine if he has prepared . i hope he does well .
oh well maybe you will get your blessings in a different way you did not expect
"its sad but true , people dont want to see others doing well ! got to be ready to protect what is yours !"
sounds exciting !
i bet that was frightening and nerve racking .
did you play there a lot as a child ?
im sorry to hear that . how long has she been sick ?
because she wanted to give you a surprise present
horror movies give me so much anxiety . i cant watch them late at night .
that is amazing . those moments are wonderful and priceless ! how old is she now ?
"it is the start of their learning journey , be excited !"
"oh no , have you made adjustments to ensure that wont happen again ?"
"oh no , is she ok ?"
how much is that ?
the quality of driving is going down and down .
did you want to go to new york ?
oh no ! was it a big one or not that big of a deal ?
"oh no , did people make you feel bad for the accident ?"
yes all it takes is cutting back on some things you maybe dont need . i know it can be hard to do though !
oh that is terrible ! what did you do with it ?
do you think it will be good news or bad news ?
"awesome , do you plan to go early to try and get autographs ?"
"i personally have not , you must have though ?"
"oh no , did you get angry with him ?"
"oh how exciting , to the big island or somewhere else ?"
oh no . i am so sorry . i have been there and its devastating . how is everyone doing ?
that is cool . what does she want to do there ?
what role did your child use .
do you have something exciting happening ?
is there another class you can apply for ?
"oh that is really lucky ! what happened , did someone run a light or something ?"
do you know what kind of spider it was ?
oh yeah ? what kind of activities ?
what exactly happened ?
uhmnnn ! so what then happened after that ?
"i have n t , though i have stepped in other poo . is it similar to others ?"
oh good . i am glad you were prepared . how did it go ?

"oh i have always wanted to live at the beach , i bet you will have a blast"

congratulations ! what degree did you get ?
oh man ! that was so nice of him ! you are lucky to have him
are you fully prepared for it ?
why do you think that is ?
"oh man , kids can be terrible about things like that . they just have no filter . what did you do ?"
so did she accept your proposal ?
how proud of him were you ?
"that is pretty good . you know what they say , c s get degrees !"
have you thought about telling the store ?
that is great ! what will you do with all the extra time together ?
those two years must have been tough . but this sounds like an exciting opportunity for you !
they are super creepy . did something happen ?
can you go to a shelter ?
that is so wonderful that you have something of hers . i am so sorry you lost her . that is so difficult . did she love cooking ?
yea that is kind of a weird situation . i am sure she would want you to have a good time though .
are you glad you watched tv all night or did you wish you would done something else ?
i am sorry to hear that . have they done any tests ?
well that is unfortunate . do you think the party will be fun ?
wow ! that is what i call couple day out !
"thats amazing , im happy for you too"
"oh man ! good luck to her , are you envious ?"
did you inform her ?
what kind is it ?
can you give an example as to someone who amazed you recently
wow ! that was incredibly nice of them . what kind of business is it ?
how long do you have ?
that is always good ! what happened ?
i do not disagree . why do you feel that way ?
how many do you get per day ?
thats super mean of them . did you give them bad candy ?
how did it change ?
exciting ! how are you settling in ? it might take a while but you will start making friends and setting up a community around you .
that is great to hear . will you be taking advantage of your life now ?
did you get caught
do you find some along time good ? do you like being alone every once in a while ?
whats that for ?
could you fight them more for the refund ?
that sucks . my parents are divorced . same reason .
"that is awesome , keep it in a safe place ."
what day is that ?
was it a surprise ?
could you explain ?
that is awesome ! anything particular you are ready to accomplish ?
wow thats awesome . i tried learning the piano once . i wasnt good . so i can really appreciate good talent . im always impressed
"i bet he will , everything always gets better dont worry"
oh no ! i am so sorry to hear that . that must have been awful .
they should be required to pay you for that . they would charge you if you tried to cancel that close to the appointment time . so annoying ! did they give you a reason ?
amazing ! i am so proud of you for your dedication !
"that is so exciting ! it is almost over ! but i can understand why it d make you anxious , too ."
"uh oh , did you try to play it off or did you have to ask your husband ?"
i certainly do . i think it shows you care and have compassion for their situations . so many people lose that compassion and even practice indifference . how about you ?
thats really sweet of you and i bet it means the world to those people . its great to show kids compassion and being nice to people
that must be hard having to be happy for someone that has what you wanted .
"campers are awesome , have you tried socialising with him ? maybee he can invite you to see it from the inside"
"i am right there with you ! i hate pineapple on pizza , it does not belong !"
"that is sad , but maybe you will make new friends at school . is it your first year ?"
thats great ! at least you found it
"thats unfortunate , maybe she will learn eventually though"
"oh no , were you driving in it , or were you actually outside ?"
what did they do to scam you ?
what was the opportunity ?
did you put money on the reno ?
that is great ! are you excited about school too ?

oh yeah ? what is happening on saturday ?
i am really happy i chose it .

they must be a very good insurance company to be able to keep your business for that lnog !
that is amazing . most of those guys have been training for years for that level of eating . what kind of pies were they ?
oh no ! sorry to hear that . can you get it fixed ?
"that is cool , i am not too familiar with it myself . is it pretty interesting so far ?"
oh no ! that is always terrible when technology stops working well . what did you do to fix it ?
im glad you were not harmed

i am so sorry to hear that ! my sister went through something similar last year and i can tell you that it will help a lot to spend time with her as often as you can .
"aw , that is never fun . my husband used to travel all the time for work and it was so lonely . i am glad she will not be gone too long . i took advantage of the times he was gone to clean and organize and fix things to surprise him when he returned ."
did you do everything right ?
why did not you sleep well ?
"oh no , why d you have to cancel ?"
holy cow ! that is amazing ! congrats !
"i hate when that happens . in my case it was a dog , i caught him on camera ! maybe you should invest in a security cam ?"
"oh no ! that would ve made me so mad . i let my kids use my computer too but always say , no drinks by it and wash your hands . kids always seem to forget that ."
did you not go ?
"oh no ! i am really bad about that , too . did you ask someone or try to play it off ?"
"mom of the year award ! that is awesome , where are you going ?"
i have n t seen it yet ! how good was it ?
why do you say that ?
yay ! i love the end of the work day ! what are you going to do when you get home ?
"that sucks but , i am glad you are enjoying your self still ."
"that is good , are you going out later ?"
"that is good , did they cheat on you ?"
i look forward to the day where i can say the same ! that must feel liberating !
i would n t want another car payment
what if he does not pay ?
that awesome ! did you guys have a good time and catch up ?
how old is he or she ?
"good job , you should do well on them if you are prepared !"
"good luck , are you pretty confident you are going to do well ?"
treadmills are great ! i find that they are better your knees than running outside .
that is so amazing . it is an incredible thing to be a parent !
do you have a lot of debt ? i am sure you will figure it out and get back on your feet .
"well , i wish you sucess"
who did ? what happened ? are you ok ?
did something specific happen ?
thats really sweet of you to help her out .
are you scared you may want to in the future and it would be too late ?
my cousin and my aunt are both teachers and they love it

its always so exciting to take a trip or vacation . but its even more exciting to see family
what sounds like a wonderful time ?
why are you so mad ?
oh wow yeah that is quite impressive ! he should become a lawyer if he is not one already !
"haha ! i know exactly what you are talking about ! i love that show and yes , it is quite gross ! you must have felt quite disgusted !"
oh no . what happened ?
"that can be a lot of work . we are trying to go through that now too , so i know how you are feeling"
"that is awful , why did he do that"
i can imagine that was very scary ! i do not know if i would be that brave !
why do you feel that way
"uhoh . be careful , there are some bad drivers out there . especially with people playing on their phones while driving"
do you guys not get together as much ?
dogs are the best
i love driving past old places from my childhood too ! they always seem much smaller than i remember
that doesnt sound very safe . i hope you dont lose power
that sucks . i know how you feel . do you have a day job ?
thats pretty neat . i think that might be worth a lot of money
well . . . did you ?
ugh . those are the worst .
do you like your new city ?
what is the cpa exam ?
"oh no , that is scary ! did his owner get control of him quickly ?"
the unknown gives me so much stress
"im sorry to hear that , is he going to the doctor for help ?"
i completely understand
"i bet ! i would be so jealous , too ! maybe your neighbor will let you come over and swim ?"
"wow ! that is cool , do you spend a lot of time with him ?"
did everything turn out alright ?
i bet that was fun
that is no fun ! how long did they have you waiting ?
it will be worth it though
"yeah , i do not think anyone likes going . how did it go ?"
"ouch , are you alright ?"
oh yippeee ! what kind of puppy ?
"oh wow , that would be nice"
"yeah that is sad , i hope it found it is owner somehow ."
try not to be . focus on yourself and your goals . use their judgmental looks to push you workout to the max !
bosses are sometimes unaware it seems
i have a pet rabbit . that makes me sad
why do you say that
wow that is super lucky ! so you have no idea where it came from ?
"that is so funny , but i know exactly how you feel . sometimes vacations can get too long . did you leave town ?"
that is good to hear . have you been ill for a while . i hope not .
i used to sit in hours of traffic daily . no longer is that my problem
i believe that was me
"ha , well i still feel bad about it , i promise"
you sound like you are going to do well then
"aw , yeah i have been missing my mom lately as well ."
that is so crazy . i love how facebook reconnects people from so long ago . do you have any plans to meet up some time ?
oh no ! what happened ?
uh oh . was it bad ?
its nice to find good deals
that sounds so nice i am jealous .
how did you do
"aww , it is nice to relive those old memories sometimes ."
kids can be annoying
what did you lie about ?
"i am a saints fan , so i am excited too ha"
that is a great attitude to have . i know it is hard to go through periods of struggle . do you have hope that things will get better soon ?
oh really ? actually i think that is a good thing . how s is going ?
they will be good again
what game was that ?
well i hope they play well for you
is it all expenses paid ?
my son really liked pokemon too ! he liked playing the card game and watching the show .
what kind of work is it
"i know what you mean , hope it gets better !"
"oh no , what happened ?"
oh wow ! how lucky ! perfect timing .
"do not be jealous , instead , brush on your studying and start going to the gym ."
"i get that , but things are still better for those around you , so it feels bad still"
i do not follow football much . were they not the favored to win ?
"oh , really ? kayaking is awesome ! what a fun and adventurous person you must be ."
i am sure it will get better
"oh , well that sucks ! it can be very aggravating to spend time working on something , and then have it destroyed !"
that is great that you have such trust in him .
i bet they will miss you not being there
i bet that is nerve wracking ! i hope you get it .
?
feeling nostalgic can be great . where are you from ?
being positive is all you can do
oh nice . i am happy that you got some rest . what do you do for work ?
oh yeah ? did you get any good tips from him ?
what kind of work is it
"well , i guess if you are a pretty regular gym goer , you should n t feel bad about missing a day every once in a while ."
"i think that is normal , are you still friends"
that is a nice way to wake up . was it a good day ?
are you excited to go back
was traffic particulary bad this morning ?
are they doing well in school ?
did you try hard ?
why did not you make any plans before the weekend started ?
"oh wow , that is impressive indeed"
i assume he got you there ok ?

"sometimes if the storm is severe enough , it is best to just pull over ."
that is always fun to look at pictures .
"i am sorry , that is always sad"
that sounds scary
that is understandable . did you end up going ?
i have felt that for sure in the past
what made you feel that way ?
that is really nice . what did you all do ?
that is so gross and rude
that is nothing to be depressed about .
did you check the last place you had it ?
i am sure you deserved some candy
"i know what you mean . my dad carries a gun in his car , so i will not let him drive my kids anywhere . what did you do ?"
"that is great , good for him ! it is always makes you feel good when your hard work is appreciated ."
how d it go ?
oh that is terrible . did you get it resolved ?
are you excited about it
that kind of stuff is always scary . do you have the results yet ?
"i am so glad to hear it ! are you feeling better , though ?"

my brother just bought a new watch and i want it so bad .
i hope you get it ! what type of job did you apply for
its nice to be prepared
its nice to have friends like that

were they good memories or bad memories ?
oh do they scare you a lot ?
oh good luck on it ! are you studying ?
did you catch them doing it ?
oh no
you must have thanked him for it . he is a smart brother !
yeah it can be tough to throw things out that remind us of special people . i still have some toys my grandma gave me when i was a baby .
oh that would be really frustrating . have you tried to do anything about it ?
that is terrible . did you tried calling him ?
"you must be feeling so anxious , yet so excited right now !"
wow ! that is an amazing accomplishment ! you must be so proud of him !
that is great ! how did it turn out ?
sounds amazing ! are you going any place in particular ?

yes that is incredibly annoying ! i am a quiet person by nature so that can drive me carzy quite fast !
you must be so surprised ! technology has really advanced in the last few years .

that could be an unsettling situation .
did you call the police ?
yeah that was good to helping others . it was a go d manner i loved it .
do you have a topic to discuss ?
"i can understand that . it is usually either parents are happy they are out of the house , or sad that they are gone . i am sorry you feel lonely ."
i can understand that . kids have a big presence and their energy creates a void . hopefully you can find things to take your mind off of it .
oh wow ! what did you do ?
thank goodness for that !
so then what did you do ?
oh no ! hopefully there is not a mess to clean up when you get back .
"oh no ! when i misplace things , i try to retrace my steps . have you tried that ?"
that must be fun for them . our neighbor hood only has older people so my kids stay around the house .

"wow so happy you got it all done , must feel nice right"
oh i bet . was it your first grandchild ?
what will you do on vacation ?
will you stay in a condo on the beach ?
that is awesome what was the play about did kids perform ?
"yes , the cable company is infuriating . do they eventually help you though ?"

"oh no , did you file a police report ?"
you have an amazing friend !
"i am not too sure about it really , but the candy s good ! what is it you like about it ?"

"uh oh , whose vase did you break ?"

i believe there are things in life that are irreplaceable and priceless ! there is no amount of money that can give you the true value of your grandfather s watch . i think you should pass it down to your grandchildren .

"nasty . that makes me want to not eat there anymore , but i guess it happens sometimes ."

that is so disappointing . people should really not be judging others when they do not know how much effort was put in to the outfit .
hi are you still here ?
i can understand that . i lost my dog a few years ago . what is worse is i was not around when it happened i was out of the state . i hope you at least got to say goodbye .
"man . . i am so sorry . i remember when i was really young , i was in the car with my mom and she hit our neighbor s cat driving home . they just ran right out into the street . she drove home and cried for a while ."

"that is very sweet . i was just dog sitting my neighbor s dogs last week . they were a little annoying at first , but i had to watch and stay with them the whole week , and i really grew to like them . they felt like my little sisters i had to take care of and play with"
have you been drinking more water lately ? or it is just happening for no reason ?
oh my ! you must have been pretty embarrassed . did someone bring you gas ?
awesome ! how was that ? do you think she will enjoy high school ?
"aww , that is so sad . i am sure she would have wanted ya ll to keep having fun times together ."
"oh , man , mine too ! it is so annoying ."
is there not an upgraded version ?
i would have though that your crystal ball would have forewarned you ?
i feel your pain totally . i take an online class and i am a teacher at a new school this year
"nice ! i hate looking for apartments . i am in college and have looked for apartments for the past three years . it gets really old after a while , since i am on a budget and it is hard to find something cheap but not a rat s nest . glad you found what you wanted ."
i hate that ! knowing a spider or any sort of bug is in your room and then knowing you have to go to sleep . i would have done the same thing .
lmao . lolol . i pay a month . you ?
"that is sad , well , happy birthday !"
"ah , so are you feeling pretty lonely ? that is interesting that he took the dog with him on a business trip , but who am i to judge ! could be viewed as kind of cool that he s that close with the dog ."
"aw , you should n t feel bad ! at some point you will have more cash and do the treating . there is a lot of give and take in relationships ."
what restaurant is it ?
what kind of food do they make ? sorry to hear that ! that is awful .
marked what wrong ?

i did too . graduated high school in
pit stops can be fun . how did you do on the scratch off ?

"i have been through quite a few tornadoes . i live in missouri , but before that i lived in kansas . have you ever had to use your supplies ?"

"oh no , you are leaving the neighbors to terrorize some unsuspecting people . that is funny ."

do not show your anger at all or let her know it got to you .

"yikes , that would drive me crazy ."
"it would drive me crazy also , she should be more considerate ."

thats a shame ! did he get any of it back ?
"hey , it is never too late . unless you can not exercise at all there is always a way to start ."
it is not good to be stuck alone . i am sure you can make friends with someone there !
oh no ! how are you handling the disappointment ?
that is a big moment . are you a little sad ?
what were you going to get ?

"i remember in highschool we had a biology teacher and the kids kept badgering him about if he had a wife . when he said he did not but he was happy the way he was , nobody understood it . it is something i found wisdom in much later in life ."
great job !
heh . . it was ok but kinda boring in a theater
i can understand . then are times when i want to get out of work too .
thats awesome . . how long did that take
i hope it is paid too .
i love fossils !
what is going on monday ?

congradulations . i assume it comes with a pay raise .
with a window ?
what do you mean ? did you get stuck somewhere ?
did you throw him out ?
"that is terrible ! i am really sorry to hear that , but even if you could have said something it does not just make it better ."
"that would be annoying . if there is anybody over him , you might try reporting it first ."
"man i have recently been getting into shoes , i dont have nearly as many as some of my buddies , need to step my game up ."
oh hate when that happens . how did you know you acted a fool
why ?
we all do stupid stuff as kids . the important thing is you realize how bad that behavior is now .
good for him ! the only time i have ever gotten a hole in one in golf is on a video game .
sorry to hear that
you and me both .
car door ?
i just found one in my toilet the other night !
that is really cool that you have those awesome memories . do you ever go baack and see your family ?
have you always had this fear of the dark
have you ever been there before ? i hear it is great !
"oh wow , where do you get these pets ? from a shelter or off the street ?"
"wow thats great , is that the one you got off the street ?"
oh my god . . i would be too ! no locks ?
have you tried find a away to keep the seperated ?
i am sure that it will get better . dogs are really smart so if you keep working with her i am sure she will get it .
i am bad with anxiety too but if you have n t done anything wrong then all you can do is try to have some self confidence and prepare for the worst and hope for the best . you never know you could be getting a raise !
prepare then and you will feel better either way it goes you will be prepared so if it is bad you will already have known and if it is not then you will get surprised . either way it will not rock your world .
that is pretty awesome . what breed
well of course . . like all the drunks and druggies begging for money who will not work on my corner ? most people are poor . . and work hard !
oh no . i am sorry
that is good that you were prepared ! puppys can be a handful .
i hear you ! tell me about your family ?

i have never actually had one of those ! we do not get very exotic fruits here in the midwest . what do they taste like ?
"never had sunflower seeds . i love pomegranate juice though . sounds interesting . do they taste anything like a watermelon , or more like a raspberry ?"
i love watermelon . . . geez i could literally sit and eat a whole one by myself . my complexion always looks better after watermelon too
"why , the odds are not in your favor"
so what was plan b ?

it happens a lot
thats always nice to have time to sit and relax
"i am sorry , any reason why ?"
"some drunks are funny , and some are unfortunately annoying as hell ."
you got lucky . i do not ever seem to get warnings .
i am happy that you think your interview was successful . i know they can be nervewracking sometimes .
i bet . that would be a bummer for anyone
why what happened ?

thats great ! you are reaching your goals then ?
that is very sweet . family is important
ah man ! you should n t feel bad about tripping . why do you feel bad about it ?

people usually dread mondays . what is happening that day ?
"cats are very fun , sometimes"
"uh oh , did something happen ?"
i can not wait for it to cool down . it is so hot here .
"oh man , that kind of thing would make me furious . do you have any idea who it might have been ?"
"i am sure they are not though , hahahaha ."
you should probably go to the doctor

"that is pretty awesome , i have never played before ! it is hard to learn ?"

it is so nice to have family be able to back you up in a time of need . have you been able to catch up yet ?
not cool ! why did you do that ?
why did you do that ?
that must be so frustrating
"oh my , how did you deal with it ? i hope you didnt kill it ."
i am so sorry that you couldnt go as i can see this was so important to you . why did you have to cancel ? must have been something important come up !
was your name on it ?
"oh no , what did it say ?"
were you guys married ?
good on you for taking that stand ! you must be very proud of yourself
"i do not really follow soccer , but it always cool for an underdog to do well ."
that is so cool !

i seem you must be quite proud of her for writing on such a subject .
i sure hope so . why do you think that it will be a good day ?
you must have been so impressed . they must have been quite talented .
oh that sounds awful ! what did you do ?
are you good at doing flatpack diy ?
that must have been exciting .
i have . it is definitely awful . it is much like losing a family member .
"wow , what a good moment you had . what did you take as your meal ?"

yes and it was the worst experience of my life . have you ?
"oh , what is the race ? sounds like a lot of work !"
cool ! what style of music ?
ha . was it geice ?
"yes , it is terrifying !"

"it would make sense . if you two are doing the same work job , it is only fair that you evenly divide the housework as well ."
"yes , it is like that all the time for me ."
that is great . i stress myself out over things and i think by doing that it makes things worse .
"oh , goodness . why did you do such a thing ?"
excatly ! i would love to know what they spend it all on
that is terrible . are you going to take of her ?
"wow , that sounds intense . what were some of the features it had ?"
yes cruises are awesome . i am sure you will enjoy it .
you must be excited !
do you still talk to the people you went with .
yeah i guess that happens every once in a while . something you went through recently ?
"not particularly . i was not my best self at that time . i suppose who really is , though ."
you must be really excited for it .
that was nice of them to chip in . it must have felt good that you had someone to help .
that is nice . do you like fishing ?
that is great . how big is the bonus going to be ?
oh no ! is everything ok ? i hope he didnt scare you
that sounds so good and the perfect way to spend a sunday .
"yes , i loved him . have you ?"
did you get tickets ? or getting ready for your licease ?
hopefully it brought back good ones . were you close to them ?
"no , do you have one really sick pet ?"
are you serious ? why would n t you pay him back .
did he do something bad ?
that must have been quite the surprise .
that sounds like a smelly situation .
was he a competition eater ?
oh man ! you must be sad . have you been bad lately ?
a workout program ?
its good to feel good about yourself
no unfortunately . have you ?
"football , soccer or american football"
oh no ! hopefully you are able to get it all fixed up so you can use it again .
you must be excited . packing can be hectic . thank god you are organized .
and what was this thing ?
"oh wow ! congrats , i know the process my husband did one . what is your on ?"
i am sorry to hear that . is it a total loss ?
"oh my , why can not they just set a time and commit to it ?"
well that sucks but at least it seems like you have a decent support system ?
did everything went as planned ?
wow thats amazing . you must be excited and full of joy !
that is awful . it is a shame that there is still racist people in !
"yes , i litke that too . do you do that frequently ?"
that is awful ! you should file a complaint !
that sucks . i hope you will not be out of transportation
oh those definitely sound like some good memories ! at least you have some pictures .
i am sure they would enjoy that quite a bit . they can make memories just like you did .
oh no are you alright ?
glad to hear you are feeling better again . how did you hurt it ?
"i feel for you , but dont take it the hard way , its well"
i am sorry you have had back luck . there are some honest people out there .
that is a really exciting time . you must be so proud .
oh that is amazing ! is it a novel ?
oh i am sorry . i hope you were not hurt !
"i know it is a blow , but you are only human . everybody makes mistakes sometimes ."
"i am very happy for you , thank god you could get a job , that is good !"
that is nice . how many brothers and sisters do you have ?
sounds like a real example of learning from the past . sorry you had to go through that . are you better now ?
"that is so funny , i was just looking at the racing schedule yesterday ! i love races if you are talking about horse races . and good memories are the best ."
that is great ! that is wonderful luck !
so you definitely believe in the old adage fail to prepare and you prepare to fail ?
that is so nice of them ! what did they bring you ?
that sounds like fun . did you see any lions ?
oh my ! you must have been terrified about it ! did you get it fixed ?
wow ! that is a very expensive car ! did they win the lottery or something ?
that is not good . can not you withhold if they refuse to fix the leak ? i would be really mad !
that is great . that is a big worry off your shoulders i am sure .
"that is great . they noticed you because you are doing a good job ,"
who felt left out ? i am confued ?
what did u do with it afterwards ?
oh that is not fun ! i hope it cleared when you took it out !
that is so cool ! you must be proud . i am terrible at hula hooping
"wow , congratulations ! are you nervous ?"
that is not right ! you could probably complain anonymously to the city .
that is nice . how many childrens do you have now ?
that is great . good job .
"that sounds frustrating , especially if they are inconsiderate and drain you of your funds . they sound kind of entitled ."
that is great ! i hope you have lots of fun and do not get too bitten by mosquitoes
wow . that was uncalled for . i am sorry to hear about that . sounds like she is not someone you would want to date anyway
that is terrible . how much did it cost you to fix it ?
oh no ! it can be annoying especially early mornings at work with no coffee . hope you stay away !
that is not good ! i am assuming they got it back on for you ?
i be you cant wait ! seeing exotic animals is so exciting !
this will be fun ! i bet your full of joy right now !
that is so scary ! did they catch him ?
that sounds awful ! did they fix the order ?
"yikes , i would ve been freaking out . how did you handle it ?"
that is so nice . . . almost a decade !
awesome first date ! hopefully it goes well for you .
oh my . i bet you were a nervous wreck . how did you find your cat ?
that is awful ! especially in the middle of summer !
that is amazing
you have to give your spot to someone else ? what do you mean exactly ?
that is great ! are you nervous about whether or not you will get into med school ?
"that is frustrating ! we have cat scratching posts everywhere to try to avoid that , but still had to put the sticky tape on the couch to prevent scratching"
what did you do there ?
"awesome , i love breakfast ! what did you have ?"
you must be proud . did her team win the game ?
that is the worst ! did you have somewhere you needed to be ?
that is awesome ! it is always good to catch up with an old buddy .
that sounds wonderful ! i am sure you
great ! what was it about ?
oh no ! i am sorry to hear that .
its always good to be prepared . i live in an area that gets hurricanes too . i have even got a generator .
oh no ! i have had that happen too ! it was very embarrassing !
"oh , i am sorry you had that experience . when i was traveling cross country , i used to facetime or skype friends and family . would that work for you ?"
i would be so scared to sky dive ! how nervous were you before the jump ?
congratulations on that . what are her plans now ?
that is very sad . are you planning on going to syria to help them ?
you must have prepared yourself for this ! you will do great !
that must have been scary ! how are you feeling ?
that is great . was it a scratcher ticket ?
how frusterating ! have you brought it up to management
i can tell the frusteration in your tone . i would go above your supervisor since nothing has been done . otherwise you will stay frustrated and angry .
wow ! i dont know what else you can do . your at a dead end right now . how annoying !
are you nervous ?
"i hate when parents do not keep tabs on their kids , especially when they are misbehaving ! what did you do ?"
i wish you the best of luck !
i bet your anxious to know what happens
who says unreal things ?
relaxation is very needful
yeah its very nervwrecking . im anxious as well to know how it turns out .
that must have taken some preparation ! how did you feel afterwards ?
"an id for glue ? what is next , showing id for buying a greeting card ? sheesh ."
"know the feeling . i had one job where i spent all day either playing cards or working online , just to relieve the boredom !"
"is there any way you can do something else during down time , or do you have to be available immediately if it gets busy ?"
i am sorry . what type of job do you do ?
whoa ! that is awesome ! i have never won anything in my life lol
oh no ! did you ever find him again ?
why did you lose contact ? what happened ?
why alone
that sounds like fun who are you going with ?
oh that sounds like fun ! what types of food do you cook ?
wow ! how content you must feel about it !
"i am so sorry to hear that . losing family can be , and is , very tough ."
the irony that the internet bill could not be paid online is kind of funny . but i can see how that would be a let down and inconvenient .
"whew , you are braver than i am ."
"really , what happened ?"
i am sure that is definitely not true . what makes you think that ?
being anxious is normal ! be yourself and you will be just fine !
im sorry to hear that ! are they trying to shame or embarrass you about something .
were you embarrassed or what happend ?
oh no . what happened ?
that is great . what do you have going on ?
oh no that is terrible ! i am sorry you had to go through that . pets are our family .
do you like it ?
oh no that is bad . did she take any medicine ?
really ? that was cool
"thats so good , am happy for you"
did you feel bad about it ?
oh no what happened ?
hopefully you do good on those and the doctor clears you .
what was a snake doing there ?
what ? why would she say that ? that is mean
you do not like reading alone ?
"oh , i am sorry to hear that , you seem upset about it ."
there will surely be maggots on that when you get home .
i agree ! especially the green ones .
i would have cried for hours .
i love pizza ! what is you favorite type ?
i try to eat the most junk food possible .
oh no that is terrible . i have had that happen once . did you find him ?
did the vet fix the dog ?
that is funny ! i agree and it is worse when they are not your kids .
i would have had a great time eating your food .
"i agree , that was a really scary one ! i think it was much creepier than average horror movies ."
how long did it take you to not be scared around your own apartment anymore ?
sounds like a good night . what movie was it ?
that happens more often that you might think . just because it is expensive does not mean it is any good .
"oh yeah , i hate that too . it is so inconvenient to be closed when people have time to go there ."

ouch ! that is not good ! think of the bright side though . better opportunities may present themselves to you !
was your dog ok ? i hope it did not run away .
you mean you stole it or they gave it to you ?
i would have screamed .

oh ? and hopefully they did not !
"wow , how exciting . are you going to go ?"
that is great ! what game did you play ? was it fun ?
that is nice . was the quilt passed down to you from her ?
i know that nostalgic feeling . time really flies .
oh that sounds disgusting . have you talked to him about it ?
that must be stressful !
i can understand . ultimately you do not have to be rich to have a kid though
that is very irresponsible from your side . it is never wise to spend your hard earned money on such leisure
i love physics !
i did not go to the gym forever ! i know how you feel though
"oh no , when did this happen ? do you think you will find him ?"
my family was over all weekend and we had a blast .
that is really great ! i am so happy for you !
i have had problems with that as well . i wish i had some advice to give .
why do you do that ? are you scared of the dark ?
that is why you never have kids .
i know the feeling ! what you have to do is call in sick on a day that you are schedule to go in .
that sounds like so much fun ! is this your first time ?
"that is wild , i wish i could write and make money ."
awesome ! were you surprised ?
ugh yeah same . did you have a nice weekend though ?
"thats awesome , is your pet being trained at a store by chance ?"
"i play some games on my pc , at times ."
that is awesome that you are getting to see your family again !
"oh i know , they are so annoying . you should try the do not call list ."
what is something that you have achieved by following your heart ?
that is a great achievement . buying a house is not easy in this economy !

what does that have to do with the school play ?
oh . how interesting . i can see why you enjoyed it .

it is a lot of work to have pets .
that is awesome ! nothing like freeing up your budget with no car payment .
that is such a wonderful surprise . you may a great wife for sure .
oh no i hope that he pulls through !
"oh no , was it a big secret ?"
omg ! did you call the police ?

it is natural that kids grow up and want a little independence . i know it happened with me .
oh i bet you wanted to over there and yell at them . some people are so inconsiderate .
mom s are the best . i miss mine so much so enjoy every single moment you have with her .
that is pretty awesome . the recognition must feel good .
that is cool . you are very fortunate .
"i live in the city too , i can not stand traffic either ."

"oh wow , what team was you watching ?"
oh my god . that is so scary !
disgusting ! i hate rodents !
i love cats ! does your cat like to snuggle with you ?
"so sorry to hear about your mom i do hope she s better now . in my personal experience , you can watch and advise all you like , but they often will not listen my mom was like that ."
"please do not be so hard on yourself . it is sometimes hard to remind ourselves that our parents are people in their own right and , while we care very much about them , at the end of the day they ll do what they think is right ."
"exactly ! you have to do your thing and she has to do hers . just by being there if she needs help , you are doing so much for her !"
"that is great , it is very useful to have a friend who can bail you out in a time of need ."
that is great because you really grew as a person .
lol that is a really good thing to not have in a diet !
did he give you a chance to tell your side of the story ?
that sounds so fun and relaxing ! did you enjoy yourself ?
i am sorry that you are missing them . maybe you can go home and see them soon ?
great to hear . i love the new car smell . take good care of it .
oh no ! that is an extremely common thing to happen . did you recover ?
oh no ! i am so sorry .
"that is great , you probably worked very hard so you deserve it ."
awe ! was that recently ?
nice ! what kind of job is it ? are you going to be a manager ?
"i boarded a flight to my destination , while on board i requested a particular drink , and it was declined"

"oh cool , is it for work or fun ?"

yeah i like looking at my old pictures too !
"wow , you must be euphoric !"
that is crazy . where did it come from ?
that is exciting . when is it ?
"dont understand you , were you chased by a hurricane ?"
that is annoying ! is someone in your house not doing there job cleaning after themselves .
how nice of them . my oldest is paying her own way . i wish i was in a situation that i could help her more .
oh my goodness that is horrible !
this happened to us last spring . our dog was years old . it can be a very emotional time but it gets better over time . have you thought about creating a memorial for him ? maybe a photo collage to hang .
that is great are you on a business journey or holiday

we watch the twilight zone too on new years . what is bomb food ?
"nice , just relaxing after a long week that sounds perfect honestly"

"wow , heard that is a tough test , good luck and i am sure you are prepared ."
that is awful . where s she staying now ?
that sounds so relaxing !
"that is awesome , reading is my favorite past time as well . what book ?"
maybe you should talk with him about how you feel ?
"that is so , so sad . are they going to separate or is there a chance that he can change his ways and earn her trust again ?"
"oh gross , you should bail quick if you see a kid getting sick , so that you will not be around to help clean it up ."
"as a matter of fact my friend asked me help him move recently , but i was busy at work too he understood"
how d it taste ? and what kind of cake was it ?

"do not think that well ! as long as you are prepared , you will do great !"
that sounds like a lot of fun . do you live in the country ?
that is adorable ! i bet you were proud !
oh no i hope she s ok ! ?
i am not suprised . i always did that as a kid .
"awww , that is sweet ! he was lucky to find such a great partner !"
the perfect person for you will come soon enough
yum ! what type of food was it ?
i would be upset too . you need to sit down and talk to him about it
"please call the police , its called noise abuse"
"aw , can not fit any classes into your schedule ?"
"aw , that is awesome . the training paid off and i bet she feels really proud !"
i hope you got a warranty on it . new cars should not have issues for a while .
oh no ! i hope that you are getting better !
is not it fun to think of times like that . when you were free of most responsibilites ?
that is great that they are willing and able to help .
oh wow i bet you were really proud ?
"that is the worst , when they take forever . . have you called them up ?"
i feel jealous i did not get the artistic genes my brother got lol
that is really awesome ! you are a really lucky person !
that is awesome . i am sure she will do great .
"oh i can relate , that happened to me with ubereats a couple days ago . its so frustrating !"
oh no ! at least you noticed now
how many slices did you ate ?
i have done this before ! it can be very nostalgic to see old friends that you have n t seen in awhile . did it bring back any particular memories ?
"i sort of have . i worked like crazy to get a work visa for the us , so i could be with the person i wanted to spend my life with . it paid off , so i can kind of understand what you are saying ."
is that a good thing or a bad thing ?
maybe you could get out and meet some new people .

"aw , that is sweet , i am glad you love her so much !"
oh my god . that is aweful !
"tell me about it , they have to be in my top things i hate the most ."
"uggh , what a buzzkill ."

"ok , why would you do that ?"
no way ! that is sad for the man but gross for you
that is awesome ! where are you vacationing to ?
i hate spiders ! especially if you know theres one in the room where you are sleeping !
that is really great that you have such a great partner like her !
"aw , dang , sounds like he is battling it very well though !"
i can definitely understand how you would be worried about that . i think i would have to decline lol ! you are a good person for being willing to meet with him .
"i have never watched a single full star wars movie , just bits and pieces haha"
you must have been surprised ! were you happy about it ?
no way ! that must have smelled so bad
"aww man sorry for your loss , those are the worst , its like losing your best friend . i hope he passed away peacefully and happy ."
it is okay ! a cheat weekend every now and then can be well deserved when on a diet ! start right now eating healthy again ! you can do it !
congratulation ! it is really smart to be as prepared as possible ! this baby will change your world !
"ouch ! that is the worst , are they pretty damaged ?"
good for you ! it is always so satisfying to look back and see how much you ve achieved .

umm . . did you mean to kick it ?
"aw , poor fellow , well i am sure he was close to his home ."
"oh you must be so sad , i know i would be if that had happened to me ."
"oh god no , my heart would be racing . were you scared ?"
"damn , i can not imagine ever going through that . i hope it was something minor and did not affect you too much ."
sounds great ! yes relaxing time is always needed and appreciated .
"i take the bus so i do not have to deal with the traffic , but man that sounds like it would really stink"
"i used to enjoy doing that with my grandmother , she d tell me all about when my dad was little . i love old stories like that ."
"oh oh , so now you do not know where your enemy is hiding . sounds scary ."
"what kind of chair is it ? a lounging chair , or maybe a computer desk chair ?"
"sweet ! , must be a really big pool if you have to wait until next summer ."
so what would you do to halt that ?
"that is not good , do you think he will pay you ?"
and no one told you about it ? maybe no one noticed it at all ?
oh my ! i hope is ok !
so how does he afford such luxury ?
how so ?
i hope she recovers soon . i know it is hard to see loved ones sick .
good for you ! you are a lucky person !
"yeah i have been through that feeling before , i had a show that was going to get cancelled but thankfully it got saved by another company . what show was yours ?"
that is really great . i am happy for you .
i am sorry to hear that you could not finish it ! what could not you finish ?
yes ! i always cried when i watched it as a child .
oh i love the thrill of a good roller coaster .
i could imagine . dogs are amazing .
"thats great , family comes first over everything !"

"thats nice , hope you will host them well ?"
oh my ! were you scared ? what did you do ?
"omg yes , mosquitos are awful . do you use any spray ?"
oh no ! i hope it di n t take that much to get in .
"i have been enjoying them too , but not quite as much as the originals . it is not my generation anymore ."
"i do not know much about cryptocurrency at all . you were brave to invest in a new thing , but i am sorry that you lost money ."
are you feeling more lonely than you expected ?
it is called the hour of the wolf .
where are you going ?
"oh do not stress it , i have done that so many times . it happens"
oh that sounds exciting . i have always wanted to go .
there is some decent benefits to doing things the old way .
"yes , i am a picky eater ."
"thats awesome , i cant imagine not having ac in this hot florida weather !"
that sounds like such a surprise . does he have a disability that keeps him at home ?
"oh awesome , what part of florida ?"
"wow , try next time !"
i am sorry to hear that . what happened ?
that is so sad . i know how it feels to lose a pet .
bet you will be glad to have some free time on your hands at last .
why do you say that ?
that sounds rather convenient . are you giving up anything for that ?
oh my goodness ! what did you do ? i bet your heart was racing !
"thats awesome , i dont have kids yet but i was also looking through some old school photos of me and my friends . such innocent times ."
i agree and it is full of commercials no one wants to see .
i would be so mad . i can not believe people can do that and sleep at night
"wow ! love birds , how nice , so where exactly are you headed ?"
how annoying ! did she fix it fast ?
"im sorry thats awful , i hope he makes a full recovery"
"that is cool , what is the position ?"
give me an example ?
"oh , that is too bad . perhaps have the picnic indoors ? it would n t be the same , but at least you could share food and have a laugh !"
who has cancer ? someone you know ?
"lol . . . . no sweetie , i am sure it is your dog again . did not the same thing happen last month ?"
i remember that . a lot of people were grossed out and did not want to do it . were your girls one of them ?
i sure hope they are trustworthy .
"i am so sorry to hear that , my girlfriend s cat is going through the same thing right now . it can not be easy ."
usually people want someone in their life . i guess that takes staying away from others .
i would laugh so hard if that was me seeing my dog do that
"i do too , its a shame"
lucky for you ! i am at work right now ! haha !
"oh , that is awful . were you okay , or did you have to go to the hospital ?"
oh wow did it bring back memories ?
well it is good to be thankful . we have to remember all the little things .
"i hope you got it on camera , i would if i was in your shoeas"
awww good for him !
i hate when that happens . i am so bad with directions .
what did you end up doing ?
oh that is great news . i bet he is having lots of fun .
that is a ton of oysters ! i do not think i have even ever eaten one oyster . what is a mixed plate ?
"that is awesome to hear , i bet the pays good too"
oh man that had to be embarrassing . i know how you feel though b c i once went to work with two different shoes on
i am so sorry . i know that must be very difficult for you . it is nice that you have pictures to look at and remember old times together .
we all do it . i bet they deserved it .
dogs can be so destructive .
"ok , so are you gon na go ?"
dang three times ? i hope you get that figured out !
"how shocking ! i have got to know , are you keeping the puppies or giving them up for adoption ?"
oh that sounds horrible . i hope it was not a long ride on the bus .
i bet so . its a shame when people dont take care of their teeth
"i have found that using alot of online recipes with good instructions helps . cannabis also induces hunger and reduced adhd thus it helps me pay better attention , even more so when i am hungry af !"
not that i can think of . can you give me an example ?
did you at least study for it ?
"oh wow , that really sucks . did you ever find the culprit ?"
i hate when they do that ! were you able to clean the rug ?
wow that is huge . he must have a lot of stuff to haul .
has it ever been a ghost ?
that is so awesome ! what did he say ?
"i am not quite sure i understand , did you go bowling by yourself ? if so that is so sad and lonesome ."
did you feel like being spontaneous or just did it for the thrill of it
yeah me too ! are you going to go with anyone ?
that is a real bummer . maybe you should take some time to reflect on their life .
that really stinks . have you gone to get some help on it ?
oh no . that sounds like a messy situation .
i am sure once you clean up your scruffy look you will be able to land all the ladies .
he must be related to my dog . was it hard to clean up ?
that is so awesome ! good for her !
"really , i can not believe you like it . are you sure he bought it and not his mom lol ?"

"yeah , i am the same way . incredibly unsafe to do such a thing ."

that sounds very relaxing . what kind of book was it ?
dang . what did you by ? mountain dew and doritos ?
"that sucks , was it a nice rug ?"
nice ! which one you getting ?
aw how wonderful . she must have been really proud of herself and happy .
that sounds like an interesting life choice . it is probably very calming .
"have you been studying ? if you do that , i am sure you will not fail ."
you are the nd one today . was it a mile high ?
oh thats a nice surprise
shocking . does that not happen often for you ?
lol owning it is just about the only thing you can do at that point !
nice ! did you steal anything while you were there ?
"congratulations , thats amazing . what did he say ?"
that is too bad . did someone cut you off ?
understandably so . you must be pretty anxious over the whole ordeal .
thats fair tho i wouldnt worry about it
that is a very nice friend . moving is hard work .
i hate when that happens . i bet that smelled great .
nice ! did you fall ?
eww i know how that feels
oh geez ! i bet that was a catastrophe !
"lol sorry for laughing , but that sounds like something i would agree to and forget , im afraid of heights too"
"oh , that is a good point ! i never realized how much money i was spending for fast food until i started making a budget ."
that sucks . are you hurt ?
thats so amazing

"thats great , good job ."

"oh boy , did you embarrass yourself by getting real scared ?"
"i know what you mean . its an easy chore , but sometimes that smell is gross . its that sweet smell . yuck"
oh really ? why was that ?

that really sucks . maybe you should get another job ?
well that is great ! i am guessing he has a bad habit of doing that ?
"oh that is so aggravating , my dog still has accidents but not many"
"im sorry to hear that , my child hood friend died in a car crash , and it hurt me for a really long time , i still have dreams about him through out the years"
"i have actually heard a little bit about cbd oil from my sister , but i never did any research myself or try it out ."
"oh wow , so it actually works ? i might have to give it a try and let me mother know about it , she has a lot of pain in her legs as well ."
that sounds like so much fun . what concert is it ?
i would n t look forward to that either . what are you going in for ?
that is super nice of her !

"i do too , but seems like most people are like that nowadays"
oops . could you sneak it back in without him seeing you ?
"depends how close you are and how mad he ll be . usually , i advocate honesty , but do not know enough about your situation to advise ."
"oh boy . i honestly do not know what to say . maybe ask him outright if he s cheating . if he is , do you really want to stay with him ? if not , it does not matter if he knows about the phone or not !"
"that sucks , hope it did not dry into the carpet ."
"thats great , good job"
nice ! where is he going to school at ?
"dangit , i would have been pretty upset , not to mention the clean up"
that is so sad ! maybe you should give him a call ?

that is a bummer . did you at least go get it resolved at the bank ?
oh yeah i could imagine . i have always lived in big cities . i could not imagine having to deal with true darkness and wild animals !
that is awesome ! sometimes pulling through a tough battle is more satisfying than just winning outright ! shows perseverance and a never give up attitude .
i am so happy for you ! i have been married for ten years and it is the most rewarding thing ever . but you should be nervous because in two months you have to share everything .

i love package delivery days ! i have got a couple coming as well . what are you waiting for ?

"dang , heartbreaking . if i were your co worker and you told me that , i would lend you at least a couple bucks for the vending machines or something . hopefully you can go home and have a nice dinner ."
"ouch that sucks . honestly , if you had a crappy obamacare bronze plan its unlikely they d pay for anything anyways . its always a nightmare . you ve got to spend a fair amont of cash before they cover anything but a checkup ."
thats a bad feeling dont be too hard on yourself
that is always a good feeling .

did you have some back up clothes ?
"i am sorry , that made me laugh . never really seen a parrot speak that well before . thought it as just something you see in movies . does it say anything else fun ?"
i am so sorry to hear that . it is hard losing someone that dear to her . i hope she opens herself up to healing .
i did that years ago in high school .
what is your wifes name ?

"that must be annoying , what kind of dog ?"
"oh no , i am sorry to hear that . what kind of test was it ?"
calculus seems like very hard stuff for anyone . do not feel too down . just use this as motivation to study more !

maybe you should confront them about it .
heck yeah . tackle the issue head on ! maybe it ll workout and they ll try to be nicer .

what was the basic jist of what they were saying ?
"that is amazing , what level is the team ?"
"that is even more impressive ! i know they take hockey seriously up there , so your friend must be pretty darn good ."
you must be some proud of that .
nice were they guy friends or girl friends
"oh , how do they go for that ?"
do they like you doing that ?
"i hate when that happens , did you try to get a refund ?"
i do not blame you ! i would ve been furious if some girl was talking to my husband that way . ridulous how awful some people are .
"i would hate that . luckily my dog makes enough noise for ! my kids are grown and gone , too ."
gosh that is horrible ! did you try to call the company ? next time chooe a company that guarantees they will come or the service is free
i am dealing with the same thing right now ! i had to teach her how to parralel park yesterday ! it is terrifying !
i am so sorry to hear that . how long has it been if i may ask ?

there is no better feeling than getting off of work !
maybe you can knock off minutes early .
that is too bad . what age is he ?
oh no ! i would have a heart attack ! are you able to take time away from life so unexpectedly to spend time with them ?

"impressive , what do you plan to do with the degree ?"
"that is the worst , what did you eat then ?"
"hahahahaha . i am sorry for laughing , but that struck me as funny . is he trying his best , or is he trying to get the point across that he should n t be cooking ?"
i hear those wildfires are getting really bad . i hope they do not affect you too badly .
"oh , i am so excited for you ! i hope you get a raise too !"
"that would be hard , can one work independently ?"
"i am sorry to hear that , what did you dog do to make you angry ?"

do not worry . soon you will get good friends .
glad to hear that . im guessing you have studied hard ?
oh no that is terrible . is there anyone near you that could be of help ? maybe a family member or someone that can lend a hand or ear ? i am so sorry to hear this .
i am happy that you got a new turkey friar and fried your first turkey . you do seem like you would enjoy that .
i understand how you feel . my sister struggled to get pregnant . she did invitro twice .
the first one did not work . apparently the second one did . . . . but that is supposed to be a secret for now . she s supposed to surprise me and my father with shirts . . . . my mom is a loud mouth and spilled the beans though .
sounds wonderful ! nothing better than putting your feet up at the end of the day . think you might watch some tv ?
"oh no ! i am sure it was awful at the time , but it ll be a good story when he grows up !"
that sucks . what type of team ?
"that is amazing , how old is your son these days ?"
that sounds risky but at the same time if it works out convenient !
"i have never cried at work , but i have wanted to lol ."
you are doing good .
where did they go ?
i bet you will do great . i would be nervous too . hopefully it will not be anything too serious and more cut and dry decision . have you gone before ?
i hate when they do that . they make it so hard to pay for
oh boy . i know just how you feel . could you persuade them to go to a restaurant ?
"good for you ! i would be so busy yelling at my husband i would forget to cook , lol . do you know them well ?"
that would be scary ! were you able to catch her ?
"wow , thats so cool ! i wish i could rock climb ."
why did you lie to her ?
that would be tough . i think i was one of the last one s not required to take foreign language .
"i hear you on that . i am visiting my girlfriend , but she still has to work , so the weekend is really the only time we can hang out . do you have any special plans ?"
"oh my gosh , i feel the same to be honest . i hate , hate talking in front of a crowd ."
"i am sorry , but that made me laugh a little bit . i have never been able to get into the idea of cats as pets just because they are so independent and determined to do whatever the want . does not seem like they can listen to any direction you try to give them ."
that sounds exciting where are you going ! ?
have you been reading reviews online ?
hey ! good luck to you ! that is got to be tough !
that is a pretty big decision to make . did she spring this up on you or was this something you knew she d eventually want ?
"that profession takes a lot of courage and a unique set of skills and personality . that is pretty cool that you took that route sometimes i think about the what if of if i took that route . pretty sure most people have that fantasy , but only the people brave enough actually go on the path to do it , like you"
"ooh , that is awesome . it is great when you can spend a little extra on the fun things ."
"i always wished i could do that with my dad . but he had a stroke in his s , and was never in good enough health to do it with me . that and i was kind of shy and introverted , so i never made friends to do it with , either . it stinks to miss the memories , but i am glad to hear you got to have them"
just try and drive carefully then . maybe the weather will change by then
"fantastic , was it a lot ?"
do you feel better now .
have you been studying ?
"that is no good , what made you smoke ?"
i am an animal lover myself . i have a cat who just had four kittens . they are adorable !
"that is terrifying , are you okay ?"
"ah , dang , did he know you were trying to buy it also ?"
well you can improvise and make everyday household items into a gym that work just a well !
oh wow ! that sounds scary ! i would be mad !
oi . . . i do not like doctors or the dentists .
that is a stress we all go through ! it is hard !
"aw , i love puppers ! what kind is it ?"
oh nice ! tell me about the new school ?
fresh socks are a treat for the feet !
"lol ! my mom used to do that with books , she would read the ending first ."
oh that is great ! i got my cat a new bed and she will not touch it
"aww , i can see how that might make you feel really bad . was it replaceable ?"
oh no ! that is horrible and those things always seem to happen when on your way to work or somewhere important
woohoo ! that sounds like it ll be a blast to drive !
i bet that was exciting to watch
"ah , i am sorry , well you can redeem your family and be a good influence to your community !"
a good feeling about the weather ?
that is neat ! where did you go ?
"maybe she will go easy on you , if this is not something you do often ."
"wow , what did you do ?"
you should probably talk to that co worker and if it does not stop i would report it to the hr
oh no ! what happened ?
that is a wonderful thing to do . what kind of tasks do you do there ?
i am sure they appreciate having people to talk to who do not judge them negatively . we have a little tent city in our neighborhood and it was just announced that they are going to be removed . that makes me sad because there is a lack of shelters .
temporary teeth ? how long do those last ?
"ah yeah , that was a pretty good idea then . hopefully she can get some permanent ones soon !"
awesome ! congratulations ! i am sure you earned it .
you are gon na miss the launch . what are you doing on here ?
have you been playing for a long time ?
i hate to hear that . did the person that got the job deserve it ?
where are you going ? are you scared of going on the plane or going to a new place ?
maybe if you search some more it will go on sale . but if you really like it you should get it .
ohhh i have been checking it out too ! what side are you going with ?
oh man . that sucks . ny is really fun . why could not you go ?
that is pretty cool ! was it a professional game ?
aw man . i am guessing you already went to the store . did you have to interact with the manager ?
congrats ! i am also working hard at getting super fit too at ! it is harder the older you are but totally doable if you are committed !
"oh no , he s probably lost . maybe you should take him in and feed him ."
at least you are concerned and interested in helping . some people would ignore the poor little kitty and just let him die . very kind of you !
that is awesome . would have been a bummer to come home to a messy house .
"congratulations , i am sure you will do great . it is always nerve racking the first day of work !"
why d you turn her down ?
i did actually .
what kind of job is it ?
i know . i just went yesterday !
"nice , that is very convenient , do you enjoy it ?"
"mmmm , i love gourmet ice cream . if i did not have self control i would be like pounds from it ."
"i love video games too , what is your favorite . i really like do not starve by klei ."
"oh no , that must have been pretty awful . do you not have self checkout at your grocery store ?"
"if it makes you feel any better , i bet that happens a lot to the cashier . they probably did not think twice or care as long as you were not a jerk ."
how are they ? are you doing pretty well in that area ?
fantastic ! being grateful is the way to be happy !
"i love dogs , what kind of puppy is it ?"
"yea , i enjoy stuff from my childhood . what kind of music are you listening to , country , rock , something else ?"
"i bet ! who do you think it is going to have the most separation anxiety , you or them ? be honest !"
that is terrible that you are being abused . who is treating you so poorly ?
are you excited about it ?
some people have no respect for otheres .
are they like level classes ? if i was in a higher class i would of straight told them to quiet down .
"yeah you ve still got some riff raff around at that level . man . . . its been a long time but , i remember those days ."
thats sick . did you report them ? they are supposed to have them cleaned several times per day or they can be shut down
"end of summer cleaning , i know that feeling , got to get ready for the school year !"
what do you have to speak on ?
"that is nice , what kind of shoes are they ? heels ?"
"wow , i hope you do get a nice bonus . sounds like you work pretty hard ."
that is so awesome . congratulations . any big plans to celebrate ?
"ugh , that is so frustrating !"
oh god . . i do not know how you military wives do it . i just can not imagine
that sounds so sweet . what was the occasion ?
where are they headed ?
"lol ! i bet , how old are they ?"
"aw , that is cute , how old is he she ?"
"that sucks , do you plan on getting a new one ?"
"that is always a good feeling . if you do not feel confident going in , you are in trouble !"
"aww , that is sad . i love any and all animals , i am sorry"
are you going to keep them

that is so exciting ! what torture waiting for a whole year ! where are you going ?
cake always hits the spot when you have a sweet tooth . was it from a birthday ?

ewwwwwwwww ! was it a runny poop or a solid poop ?
oh i bet ! did you move far away ?
i am so sorry . did they give you another one for free ?
why did you feel like you needed to steal candy ?
"lol . . . . best thing to do when that happens is deny , deny , deny ."

have you found any good ones ?
"wow , how amazing ! i love surprise parties . did you get a lot of good stuff ?"
"aw , i am sorry to hear that . is she still alive and well ?"
did you nurse her back to health and get some weight on her ?
"oh no , it really sucks seeing someone you care about date someone who is not good"
that is really rough man . is there any way you can get her back ?
those good old times of fantasy . kid s world is so full of imagination and self scaring created things
oh no ! how old is he she ?
now why is it going to be scary ? going to a haunted house ?
oh no ! that is one of my biggest fears ! what did you do ?
"oh no , i know that is so disappointing first hand . the same thing has happened to me for the last three years . is everything going well , though ?"
i hope it went well ! ! she is alright now right ?
congrats ! that is great news !
that is so scary ! i hope your dog is ok .
"eh , you will get there eventually . besides , big houses are not even that great ! all you need is a moderate amount of space to live comfortably ."
"well , since he s supposed to be in the water , you may have a fatality on your hands ."
i love animals too . what are their names ?
ah that is so terrible . did you find him ?
that is terrible . did he get hurt ?
oh no ! do you have any other work lined up ?

"really ? what was it , that must of been pretty wild ."
i hope too ! ! i think you will do well ! !
dang . do you have the whole house to yourself ?
that is funny . dogs can be careless . you should take better care of it
it makes me feel the same . that is why i voted for myself in the last election .
that man is a winner if he kept it all down !
i am sorry that keeps happening to you .
that is pretty unlucky . at lease it was not a power outage though .
that is terrible ! is it a festering wound that will turn you into a zombie ?
you must be really excited of the interview and i hope you will do well
that is so exciting ! what did he say ?
"dang , that is rough . are you set up for next month at least ?"
that is so nice of them . where did they find it ?

oh no ! ! that is just terrible . did you made him to clean by himself ! !
really ? i am thinking about buying one myself . what kind are you getting ?

that is such a great age . is he doing well ?
hmmm . have you asked to go over for a dip ? he never said you could not come over and partake in the fun !

you should get some bug spray . fly s are nasty
"same , my friend ! france played so well ."
"ah , happy birthday in advance to you . and what is the plan"
used to be ? what happened to it ? did it get closed down ?
that would get very irritating . have you talked to her about it and let her know how you feel ?
"ah , you are going to miss him"
i am so happy for you !
i have no idea . what happened ?
does it bother you when she does that ?
did you just clean your place ?
"only you can change that , my friend !"
that is terrible . have you gone to a dentist to get it checked out ?
are you nervous ?
"that is not good , i do not think iguana s can live out in the wild ."
that must be great !
"oh no , that is embarrassing . were you able to recover by the end ?"
i am so sorry that happened to you . will you get another crack at it sometime ?
you must be very comfortable in your office ! how did they react ?
aw yeah ! what year are you in college ?

that is pretty neat . did you buy anything cool ?
that must bring up scary memories .
that is scary ! did you chase it away and show it who s boss ?
oh no ! i hate when that happens ! does it still hurt ?
i imagine that must have been quite a lonely experience for you . did you see any ghosts ?
"that is awesome , i bet she loves you just as much !"
ewwww . maybe you should put them back in the oven for a bigt ?
haha ! did you just eat a bunch of mushy brownies ?
why not ?
that is awesome ! what type of work will you be doing ?
"wow , that is quite a feat . did he get sick ?"

"uh oh , what did you do ?"
aww that is awful . do you have to move like for a job or something ?
"nice , how much was it worth ?"

"i remember my first city apartment , the lights and sirens . it can be difficult ."
jeez . was it audible ? smellable ?
i would do that to .
from your house ? do you have any idea who did it ?
they must have been quite good .
"lucky ! last flat i had was on a gravel road in the middle of nowhere , lol ."

oh no is your dog okay ?
hey that is sweet ! what for ?
i am very proud of you ! keep it up !
is it for your work or part of any school projects you are having ?
garbage collection most important

what movie is it ?
"what a way to wake up ! that is awful , what happened ?"
"you uttering this phrase , i remembered the peter griffin meme . so tell me , what grinds your gears ?"
oh no ! why did not you keep it in the attic or something ?
is she a good driver ?
"congratulations , is in an area that you are interested in ?"
i am sorry . what happened to the cat ?
"haha , i am with you . that is the worst , it almost ruins the meal ."
i am happy for you !
ok
"that would make me angry , and it is impossible to deal with in a drive thru ."
good thing your boss was available . i would not worry about being embarrassed . we have all done something dumb .
"i would be pretty furious as well , those can be expensive to get removed !"
i am good . how about you ?
oh dear . did they find out about it ?
that is such a great feeling ! congratulations on all the hard work you put in paying off !
that is awesome ! do you think you are prepared ?
"yikes ! that is scary , what did you do about it ?"

"that is gon na take some time . i love their designs , but i hate the assembly !"
oh no ! what had happened ?
oh what did he make you ?
"ah , a plunger did not do the trick ? hope it was not too expensive !"
oh that is sad . i hope you can spend some good time together then .
that is awesome . i saved up for months but then had a massive car repair bill . .
that is so frustrating ! do you know who it is ?
"wow , that must have made you feel so good about yourself ."
that could be kind of scary . have you tried to meet anyone that might could show you around and then maybe you would not be so lonely ?
good for you ! it is really dangerous to do that .
was it the meg ?
that is so messed up .
nice . i love donuts . are you going to go there as soon as they open ?
yes i agree . i love to watch them do their routines on tv .

yikes ! that made a mess i bet . did you get burned ?
oh my god ! that sounds terrifying
"me too , i am excited for fall , i like to layer my clothes"
i would love to try them .
do not be so hard on yourself . some people are just naturals !
you should put some time aside to study .
by who ? who are you trying to get noticed by ?
that is nice to hear ! have you treated her to something special ?
that must have been very humiliating .
"oooh , sorry , that must have been embarrassing"
oh no ! was it a small local place ?
ouch . i actually have done that before too though . . .
jeez that sucks
"oh , that is just awful . losing someone is so hard ."

"wow , that is impressive !"
it is good to hear ! are you alright now ?
"a hike in your package ? i am sorry , i do not follow . as in how long it would take to get there to you ?"
that sounds like it would be pretty gross .
that must be a relief .
"oh i understand , mine is only right now but i feel that way too when going through his preemie clothes . you probably feel it much more if they are grown though ."
what a beautiful memory tho to have ! yeah a little weird but a little cool too !
oh no ! what kind of exam was it ?
"oh , do not worry . you will get good response . what was the email about ?"
in his work ? or life ?
thats good to hear . being independent all your life and then being cared for all the time can be a hard transition
oh i hate when that happens . did you make it on time ?
that sounds so fun . what great friends !
"losing weight is the best feeling . i did that a couple of summers ago . . it is one of those few things where you can visibly see yourself getting better , and there is not much that gives you as much pride as that . congratulations !"
"there is always social security and part time jobs , that seems to be the norm these days . a lot of old people do not have enough saved"
what place did you go to ?
"glad to hear your life took a turn . it is always weird , and even sometimes funny , to look back on your life to see where you came from , and how different and sometimes worse things were"
wow ! how often do you play the lottery ?
that is awesome . how was the rest of the show ?
did they go away or did you break up ?
"good mom , or dad ?"
oh man ! was it poisonous ?
"hmm , what state do you live in ? although i am in michigan and we have poisonous ones here too . i did not even realize in mid michigan we did until i almost stepped on one . . i had a panic attack too lol"
ah i am sorry to hear that . were you really busy today then ?
"those sound super effective . i wish i had some of them here , i have never seen mosquitoes as bad as they are this year ."
"oh , that is disgusting ! have you tried to talk to them about it ?"

"well hey , happy early birthday . i am happy you take a positive spin on it . . i wish i could do that myself . i hate mine , always dread when it comes . makes me feel like i have n t achieved what i would have liked to have achieved at the age i am turning to , so i just get self conscious about it ."

how do you think you did ?
maybe you could take one soon .
i would be mad as heck . did you confront them about this behavior ?
is there a reason you get so emotional besides them being improtant to you ?
"i understand that , it is not fun to not make money the way others do"
i am so sorry to hear that . any news back yet on what it could be ?
that would be really scary ! what do you do if they get close to your home ?

are your cats ok or are they sick ?
i would ve went flying if i heard that ! what was it ?
"haha oh boy toddlers , they can be a real handful ! my daughter is almost so i understand !"
that is unfortunate would it be feasible for you to just sell your car and work with public transportation for a while until you can afford it ?
why is it sad ?
i know right ! what shows did you watch ?

i can imagine it was ! wow . did you enjoy yourself tho ?
what happened ? sometimes people are just having bad days .

as long as otherdays you are eating healthy i think its fine to cheat once in awhile
"who has n t that happened to before ! if it took you that long to notice , i bet no one else noticed . were you able to fix it later ?"
i love the feeling a rollercoaster gives . have you gone before ?

that is awesome . you sound confident .
that is too bad . do you mow a lot ?
and how does that make you feel ?

your company left you alone ? in what way ? that does sound like a troubling situation .
what is your character ?
i just love fall ! i am guessing that is your favorite season ?
"awh that does sweet of you , what kind of pet is it ?"
where were they
i know how you feel i can be lonely sometimes .
oh no ! i am so sorry to hear that !

i was late to an appointment recently because i got stuck in a traffic jam .
what kind of prank did he pull on you ?
how soon after did the beatdown come ?
did you talk to your boss ?
that is such a shame . could you perhaps join them for a couple of days ?
what ended up happening ?
"oh no , did they leave a note ?"
that sounds pretty awesome . how long until you get off from work ?
did someone give you a recipe or did you google it ? keep tasting it until you get what you want !
i love ramen ! not the healthiest food in the world but tastes good and hits the spot
"exciting , is it hazardous scary or more excited scary ?"
"well , go in with an open mind and maybe your experience will be different . and be sure you pay attention to the safety requirement !"

"i know i am really exited , what do you have planned ?"
"that is so awesome , have you been accepted yet"
any damage to where you live ?

"yikes , were you able to clean it up ?"
what did you guys eat ?
what contest is that ?

how long has it been since you have gotten a raise ?
not worth the risk is it ?
oh no ! is he she okay ?
seriously ? what was going on ?
that is such an exciting time and really nice of everyone to do that .
"that sounds nice , how long has it been"
"wow , great ! you must be so proud !"
congratulations ! you must be very proud of her . what kind of recital was it ?
could you call people ?
that is lucky do you talk much in class ?
its good that you like it so much . why are you worried that it will close ?
"oh no , did anyone see"
i am so sorry to hear that . were you able to be there when she passed ?
how was the service ?
did you dig it out of the trash ?

sounds like a fun thing to do . what kind of racing did you see ?
yes ! i love halloween . i need to start making plans myself .
that was really nice of them ! i am glad you got some help
"that is not good , do you have any idea why you spaced out"
are you one of the uber drivers ?
"that is a special moment . to hopefully see your kids doing better than you and all that jazz . i am in college but my parents live only a couple hours away , so i just visit them instead , since them coming to me wouldnt be anything too special . but congratulations to you and your kid"
it is great to hear that you are in such good shape ! i need to work on that myself .
that is a nice way to remember him . its good that you have something of his to keep his memory alive .
"yeah , do not be too hard on yourself for that . we re supposed to like that stuff ."
"i used to be that way , because i love holidays and the mood it puts everyone in . but i am starting to hate how short the fall and winter days are , and how quickly it gets dark . now that i have been exercising outside more lately , i hate losing that time in the sun"
that must have been painful and a little embarrassing !
"yikes . i live in the south and we do not get those . just palmetto bugs flying roaches . i think i would rather have those than rats , personally ."
i am so proud of you ! that is a lot to deal with all at once !
that is very sad . my grandma had that and it is devastating to experience it . i am told that doing puzzles etc . keeps the brain active and maybe at least delays it .
"i hear you there , it can be more relaxing spending time at home thang going to a hectic party ."
i would be so excited ! i am so proud of you !
that is annoying . maybe you should try giving them a call again ?
oh . do you have to buy a lot of presents or do you just not know what to buy ?
i understand . you know there are websites were you can answer a few questions about the person you are buy a gift for and then it makes gift recommendations for that person .
"oh wow ! that usually does not happy , usually that feeling fades with time ."
wow that is awesome . you must be feeling pretty content .
"that is pretty cool to hear . when i have kids , i hope they are the same , and can get into sports , since it offers so much . good for you for getting them into sports"
did you bring it in and take care of it ?
did the neighbors come after you ?
maybe or at least recovered your basketball !
how nice ! are you going out or are you going to have a nice night in ?
congratulations ! i am sure you are very happy and beeming with pride right now . whats the next step for her ?
how scary ! i hope your neighbors are ok .
"awesome , what kind of restaurant is it ?"
oh wow a wonderful surprise indeed !
that is really cool . did it bring back good memories ?
i guarantee you know more than you think ! just be methodical and you will do just fine .
oh im so sorry you felt this way ! i hope your mood will get better . maybe watch a good comedy ?
"that is terrible . . there is nothing more frustrating and deflating in life than unexpected expenses . i hope you are able to cover all of it . i know if i had one right now , i might not be able to manage it ."
what was she so negative ?
"oh that is terrible , getting delayed always annoys me"
"that sounds so nice ! i love to be with my dog outside too , even if just watching him play ."
"that is great , what did you have for lunch ? i had some hot dogs and baked beans"
how did you like it ? did it give an energy boost ?
you know there is one thing that might make it even better .
i wish i could go to my old high school . i moved far from it but if i come back i will visit
ewww . i hate it when dog owners do not pick up after their pets . we always carried a poop bag with us for when our pooch went .
thats amazing ! he must really really love you .
that is pretty gross . were there other people around ? i am always more nervous about that when people are around .
haha oh no . sometimes you need a cheat day .
it is good to be confident . i am sure you will get some good news soon .
wow ! was your order important ? have you called the post office to find out what happened ?
awe ! hopefully they were cute pictures
"congratulations ! it is not easy moving to a new place , but it is great fun getting to know your new home !"
did you wind up eating it ?
happy early birthday ! do you have any plans ?
"that is terrifying , did you get away from it ?"
have you been expecting it long ?
you dont like to gossip at all ?
is this brother of your s a lot younger than you are ?
"what what , tell me ?"
you must miss her . but i am sure she ll be back before you know it !
well thats disappointing . maybe you can find a show similar to it to watch .
did you flip the bird ? some people are so rude .
well it is a teacher s goal to make sure his or her students succeed . she wants you to do your best .
must feel good to get it over with . how do you think you did ?
"yes ! i bet it will , did you go in and kill it ?"
"thats amazing , i have actually had that happen to be before in my life , i was so happy"
what did you fail ?
i almost feel like homework is counter productive . should n t the schools be teaching the kids enough during their hours ?
i am sure there ll be other games it will be useful for .
i built my own too a few years ago .
"that is a shame , do you have anything else lined up ?"
is that a bad thing ?
oh that cinnabon smell can be so enticing !
oh man ! i would be so excited ! when do you go ?
talk crap get smacked
"mcdonalds is honestly gross to me though , rich or poor . i dont eat it ."
"oh my god , thats it so gross , cat pee is the worst ."
that sounds like quite a ride . are you a fan of rollercoasters in general ?
that is great to hear . anything new going on ?
did it do much damage to your car ?
"dang , that really blows . what was it made of , glass ?"
did you get up to go check to see what it was ?
how long did it take ?
that is awesome . what band is it ?
it is hard for kids to do that . maybe he was just bored ?
thats a nice feeling to have job security . do you enjoy your work ?
what did you hear ?
that is great ! have you had good things happen ?
it sounds you you didnt leave anything out . it feels good to bell prepared .
that is really awesome ! i never win anything either . . .
that is great ! congrats ! i am glad to hear that . you deserved it
me either . its too much
that is good . what have they done for you ?
oh no ! did you scold the dog ?
its really good that you have friends like that . i am sure they realize that you are just joking with them !
that is great . what kind of work do you do
that sounds so good !
oh nice ! what kind of phone did you get ?
"oh , now that is exciting ! do you have any plans to do it ? celebrating with anyone ?"
"that is wonderful ! i am happy for you . hopefully he got you something meaningful , sentimental , and long lasting so that you can keep on enjoying it !"
"oh man , sorry to hear that . i mean good for your friend but i feel you . i never win anything"
a backed old man ?
that is really cool . what is your idea ?
"that is really kind of you , many people would not bother . i hope that she wins her battle ."
"chemotherapy and radiation can really take their toll . there is a program through the cancer society that does a day of beauty with cancer patients . they give them a makeover , giftbags , wigs if needed ."
why s that ?
oh no ! if it helps they probably do not remember . that stuff filters out faster than you would think !
im sure they understand . that is a tough position to be in .
did he hurt the baby ? most of the time they are just curious
"aww , did you take it home with you ? it is great to adopt strays ."
i totally understand that feeling . it is very frustrating . all you can do is try your best and try not to pay too much attention to that aspect .
that sucks .
oh that is the best . did you buy anything ?
do it ! she may say yes !
"wow , thats really lucky of you . its good to find nice people out there"
was it good ?
about what ?
how did it go ? s eeches can be intimidating
that is great you have such great friends !
oh man that is a bummer . did you leave her or are you giving her another shot
a rat ! i would have died
that is nice of you . i hope he appreciated it .
that is sad . what happened ?
oh i love vacations ! do you love the water ?
you must be very proud . that is awesome .
that is wonderful !
oh no ! i hope that you were able to get someone to fix it !
"oh no , i am so sorry to hear that . my cat is getting old , she s . i am scared she ll pass soon too"
sometimes it can be difficult to get your footing when starting out . it sounds like you enjoy your life now and have something to be proud of .
that is . . . exciting . .
"that really sucks , i have had that happen to me as well ."
that really stinks . maybe you should try and find something that your good at and do that !
cool ! did you go to greece for vacation ?
that is awesome . i hope that it goes well !
i am so happy for you . doe she make you feel special ?
what did he do to inspire such pride
"wow thats really impressive . well i need to be open . flow to me money , flow to me . . ."
"oh that sounds great , i hope you get it !"
maybe she will let you borrow it . or maybe if she gets a new one she will give it to you .
you got an awesome girlfriend . who are you going to see ?
whoa that is out there . takes some real confidence to rock that .
i know the feeling too . i am a miles from my family .
yeah same to you . i am counting down the days until i get to see them again .
oh my goodness . that is crazy . i have never had anything like that happen .
oh yeah ? how did that go ?
that sucks . did they give a reason ?
"yikes , you got ta pay more attention to your textbook maybe"
that is too bad . maybe you can call them ?
"yikes , that is really cruel of him to do that . i am sure you are trying the best you can"
"wow , that is nice . what does he understand ?"
who left all the dirty dishes ?
"good for you , have a beer for me !"
it is always good when a friend meets his potential
oh my goodness that is horrible . how come it did not recognize you ?
what is wrong ? what are you visiting the doctor for ?
oh no ! before he got to have it ?
"why , did someone cancel on you ?"
what was high school like for you ?
that is great ! how far along is she ?
that is infuriating . i dont see how some people are so unaware .
oh nice . any big plans for it ?
"that is sad , how old was your pet izzy"
well that is quite the accomplishment ! how did you train her ?
sorry to hear that . you get it fixed already or what
awesome . sounds like you are defintely on top of the world today !
oh my ! i hope that it goes well !
oh how exciting . what grade was it from ?
what is the longest you have been apart ?
"wow , that must be exciting . do you have everything prepared ?"
"whoa , that is quite the confession . but you know , it is good that you recognize that you need to change a behavior . very mature . not everyone has that same ability to be honest with themselves , and you should feel proud about that !"
i have always gone by if you learned from your mistakes you have no reason to regret them
oh that is awful . i have been fired before it is just the worst . have things gotten better since then ?
that is good . is it your manager who did the review ?
i hate when that happens . my dreams are always so vivid they feel real .
oh my word . that is like a nightmare not a bad dream .
oh no i hope everything goes well !
do you live on a farm ? it will probably be nice to move to a city and get away from those chickens .
do you do it out of necessity or because of the thrill of it ?
why is that ?
what games did you liked ?
"just wear cologne , dress sharp , use mouthwash , and let her do all the talking . and you will be just fine"
that sounds awesome ! i wish i could go !
aw i am sorry to hear that . i am sure he was a good pet .

whoa congrats . you must be very excited .
oh my goodness that is horrid . i would think with hot water and degreaser .
oh wow where are they ?
oh no ! i am so sorry are you going to be alright ?
i would be afraid one of them would get out !
that sounds like it could be a great success . do you both work well together ?
nice how old are they
"oh , thats embarassing . i hate it when that happens ."
"ew , yeah it is not worth risking getting food poisoning !"
oh no ! have you already had some tests or is this the first time ?
i am so sorry to hear . what is the problem ?
"that is so exciting , how long do you have to wait tell you find out if you are accepted or not ?"
that is great news ! i am sure he feels a great deal of accomplisment
that sounds so annoying !
really ? how come ?
how old are you ?
oh no ! what do you think had happened or triggered it ?
they are really impressive . what circus was it ?
did you call the police ?
that is the worst . i have that happen all the time but with onions . its the only thing they have to do so get it right !
why would you be worried ? do you have three arms ?
how come . is their something wrong with it ?
i hope they come back with the desired result . good luck

that is a good long time ! i am sure you have many more ahead of you !
"ah , that is unfortunate . that can be really tough to remember sometimes . i know because i have forgotten that too . but you will make it up as soon as you can , i am sure !"
did they leave a note or anything ? i would be really upset too . were there any cameras that could have seen who did it ?

those are always good memories
aw that sounds sweet . you are wonderful for doing that and i am sure you can not wait to get there !
"what kind , is she alive ?"
did you threw it back into his car ?
were you happy to see him after that long time ?
"yes , i think people that work these jobs should call in sick when they are not in a mood ."
did you end up reading any reviews on it first ?
did you go back ?
"great , for what store ?"
why did not you ?
were you shocked it happened so fast ?
what happend ? do you have test results pending ?
"cool , where did you go ?"
i love coming home too .
really ? what was it about ?
is this your first time ? i know that is something that i would even ever consider . my fear of heights would render me completely lifeless . so are you doing the real skydiving or in one of these indoor skydiving places ?
if your son is very young and you give him an allowance then tie it to that !
how what made you feel ? do tell
"man what happened next , i would have been looking for a place to hide"
that sounds like your job is going well .
"that is great for your sister , but you must have felt left out ."
did she invite you another year ?
did you have fun when you got to go ?
what instrument do they yplay ?
do you have all your gear ready to go ?
oh no ! you must have been pretty frustrated .
oh yeah ? are you excited ?
"oh no , i bet that is frustrating . have you ever used him before ?"
"that is a bummer . sorry to hear that but i am sure you can reschedule , right ?"
"awesome , i love pasta ."
"lol that sounds wild , did you text them something appropriate ?"
that is the worst ! what did you do ?
awww how sweet . is he your only child ? it does get easier . . . .
"i just can not understand why people will not do their job properly , i had to cut my lunch break in order to do more work"
that is nice from you . what card is it ?
"oh wow , that sounds unfortunate . is there no way to ask the neighbor to take it easy ?"
"aw , good on her . i bet she knew exactly how it would make you feel , too . things people do personally themselves always have the better result ."
"i know that feeling , so frustrating ! do you think there is a chance the person will change ?"
oh god . . they do that to me too ! and we have poison water ! are they going to fix it ?
i am sorry to hear that . do you have a plan to change things ?
oh that is nice ! why did they move back ?
that happens sometimes but i am sure you will make a lot of new friends in your new job .
could it be fixed at all ?
how excited are you ? i did not know they still made those .
whoa that is awesome . i could never be on that show .
just keep trying and you will eventually land something
oh really ? what kind of girls ?
oh no ! how frustrating ! what did you do ?
"wow , congratulations ! did you save up a long time for it ? what kind of car is it ?"
"i love that model , man i am jealous . i bet it was agonizing to have to save and resist the temptation , but wow it is so worth it now , huh ?"
good for him . so where did he go ? i will make a guess . is it miami ?
"that is great , do you have any other classes this summer ?"
thats awful ! is she changing her diet ?
were you drunk or tired ?
"you are so lucky , and must be really excited !"
congrats ! that sounds like a lot of fun . do you already have a bike ?
oh ! were you really scared ?
yes it has been too hot for too long
i apologize i thought we were discussing winter coming soon
good friends are invalueble .
was it a slow leak or was it somethign else ?
"that is great news ! i find most people are good , honest folk . it is the few rotten ones that make us forget that ."
"wow , did you see a doctor ?"
do you expect it to be positive ?
"that is good , are you going to have a nap ?"
that is great . do you get a bonus ?
that must be such a relief to get another semester behind you . it is hard waiting to get your grades though i am sure .
"well , it is good you have a friend that is so close to you that you feel comfortable sharing with them ."
that is so annoying . maybe you should leave earlier next time too .
about what
really ? what did they do to impress you so much ?
that is great . did you watch all harry potter movies ?
did it bring a lot of memories ?
"well , that was not a very nice thing to do ! think of it as getting a new beard , rather than losing the old friend ."
i do not think you are overreacting . that is something important to you and they should have realized that . maybe it is time for new friends ?
that is nice of her . what was the occasion ?
that must be stressful to your friend .
omg that must have been really embarrassing . did anyone came to your rescue ?
oh that is so nice ! was it a special occassion ?
hows that working out for you .
"yes , you were just mentioning it . what happened ?"
oh that is so wonderful ! how old is he ?
that was nice of you . what kind of soup .

that is annoying . have you talked to your boss about it ?
oh that is great ! i have had great success doing keto and fasting for not feeling so hungry ! carbs and sugar do me in ! what kind of lunches do you make ?
that is horrible ! what happened to you ? who stabbed you in the back ?
"that sounds interesting , i would love to get a piercing . where will you be getting the piercing ?"
oh no ! i would be so angry !
"wow , i bet he was really surprised he got to meet him . what did he think of him in person ?"
"oh god , i hate flying . i always seem to get the plane that ends up having some issue ."
"haha . . i am sorry , that made me laugh a little bit . i do that sometimes too , and have no idea how i can forget so many times . i think at least if it happens , almost no one can really tell or notice , if that helps ."
did the company not pay you well enough ?
gross . what did you do ?
that is amazing ! i bet she had to work hard for that .
"i am sorry to hear that , hopefully she naturally mellows out ."
how exciting ! i remember when my girls said their first words ! what was his first word do you know ?
"wow , good for her ! i am sure she worked really hard to get a degree"
i am so sorry that you have to go through that on your day off . just try to be nice to her .
i do not envy you there . i have done the blind family meeting at a holiday dinner before . it is nerve racking .
"oh no , i am so sorry you have to leave your furbaby ! give her lots of extra snuggles and explain to her that you will be back and i am sure she will be delighted to see you upon your return ! ! have you ever left her before ?"
that is awesome ! does he have any plans for what he s doing after high school ?

ahhhhhhhhhh ! that is amazing . i am so jealous of you . where are you going ?
where is that ?
ah thats so bad . why not raise a complaint
oh no ! do they have . alost and found ?
oh nice . is he the type to tone himself down in social settings . . . but he s secretly a wiz kid
i call them hypocrites . they take advantage of people whenever it suites their needs . can not stand the presence of such people
"i love dogs , and have three myself . what type of breed is the puppy ?"
oh no ! what happened ? do you think you did ok anyway ?
"i know how you feel , my brother is my best friend but i only talk to him about once a month because he is so busy . where is your brother now ?"
oh no ! did it leave a dent ?
nice ! how d you do
did this happen recently ?
"i am sorry to hear that , was it his fault ?"
are you jealous by this or does it make you angry ?
true . do you have any plans for the weekend ?
that is awesome that you have such friendly coworkers !
did you find out what it was
"i am glad you are feeling well , it is always important to make your health a priority , without our health we have nothing !"
that is disgusting . what kind of parent lets their child run around like that .
sweet ! would n t mind one myself . what do they cost new ?
that is really mean . i am sorry .
do you think she will keep you awake ? how old is she ?
that is so amazing . animals have an amazing ability to find their way home . i wonder if it was out there having a homeward bound style adventure .
oh that would kill to see . maybe he will hook you up .
thats awesome . do you look like him ?
a little homesick ? are you traveling for vacation or for work ?
"oh my god , that is terrible . has it affected you knowing you slept through that kind of event right next door ?"
"yes , it is important to find somebody who you will be able to trust and also somebody who will love you for being you"
oh no ! can you ask for an extension ? sometimes they ll be quite accommodating .
good . where are you going ?
now that is something i would imagine is hard to deal with . i hope you are in a better place .
"oh that is terrible . i would n t shut it all out though , you could miss out on someone great ."
that is really kind of you . not everyone can or will do that . i do hope she pays you back !
"i am sure ! it is always nice to help someone in need , but you do hope they ll do the right thing by you when possible ."
you are obviously a very good person and i am sure your friend knows that she ll repay you when she can .
"that is pretty heavy . i hope that does not discourage you from trying again in the future , especially with a rescue dog or something in that area . if you do not mind me asking , what happened ?"
"that is so great that he was able to go . i had the same problem as you , but i started at community college when i was and finished at a year college when i was . it is never too late for you to go ."
awesome . is it the first ime ?
that is horrible . is it treatable ?
"everyone in life has problems , do not feel bad for sharing yours i hope it gets better for you ."
that is fantastic ! it must be a good day for you .
a little anxious ? have you ever flown on a plane before ?

"he did the right thing , how did the teacher react ?"

"i am so so sorry to hear that , it can not be easy being in that position . have you spoken to anyone close to you about it ?"

why was that ?
well i hope he cleared it up that is not a nice thing to wake up to !
"i have had that feeling as well , especially if it is with someone that is close to me . is it because you dont like confrontation or a different reason ?"

"oh geez , stay safe ! tornadoes are one of those weird things for me . they sort of scare me but before they happen and its raining yet still outside i love going out to see whats happening ."
it is important to have a focus on something positive .
"that must mean they think you are a pretty cool person ! people usually do not go through that kind of effort unless they think you are worth it and deserve it . so , kudos to you for having that kind of effect on others !"
you may need to go to the barber shop !

that is really something to be thankful for . i have lost . . . so for sure !
where did you go shopping ?
i love the thrift stores . i can spend hours in there .
"i buy a lot of kids clothes from there . i also go to a salvage store called dirt cheap , great deals !"
do you feel like you are prepared ?
wow thats horrible . i hate the way they make the system to steal money
i saw it when i was much older but my parents did not let me watch it when i was young . i bet . that would n t be like real life for really being left home alone .

wow ! did she say yes ?
"oh no , i am sorry . what went badly ? one things or just lots of little things ?"
oh fantastic ! what did you guys do ?

ugh hate when that happens . . . do you live alone or with roommates
how did it go ?
"wow , thats horrible . what were they stealing ?"
that is cool . sounds like you are an animal person
"i agree , but maybe you should be a little less aggressive"
"oh im sorry to hear that , what caused this ?"
"that is fantastic , you must feel really confident in your ability ."
that must have been nostalgic . when did you last pick one up ?
oh no ! was it expensive items ?
"interesting ! i could see how you thought that . just because they are homeless and have fallen on hard times does not mean they are dumb . but yeah , there is a good chance they did something wrong to be in that predicament , so their judgment could be questionable ."
haha im terrible with names too . but for me there are only types of people ones that are memorable and ones that are boring and if you are boring i definitely will not remember who the hell you are
that is very lucky ! did you see who dropped it ?
is everything going perfectly ?
i get that ! what show is it ?
oh no ! was anything taken ?
we all have weeks like that . do not be too hard on yourself . everything will get done eventually .
thats great . im sure it was cheaper than having to buy a brand new one .
oh my goodness ! months ? ! where are you going ?
that sounds like a great way to keep yourself motivated !
what kind of job ?
"oh no , how did it happen ? were you in a hurry ?"
"oh my , that is tragic . i hope you are there to support him ."
that is pretty hard my dude . but join some clubs or get to know some people in your dorm area .
do you trust other people at all ? it seems like it would be hard to trust someone if you think only you can know what is best for you .
how big is it ?
did you think a bear was going to eat you ?
"oh wow , this is my passion too , which eu country are you going to start first ?"
lol . but i will feel accomplished . i would pop a piece of sugar really lol
as reunions go i guess . how was it crazy ?
"good for you . we only get one body , got ta take care of it best we can !"
lol . well then darnit i want to be a unicorn .
lol well that is true . darn all those people who stopped me from being a unicorn . well how on earth did you get back to earth then ?
i am sorry to hear that . unfortunately a lot of dog breeds have a high risk of cancer . is it treatable ?
that sounds terrifying ! i would n t want to stay alone either . that was nice you guys took her in .
"that is not good , why did you miss your son s game ?"
did you try to pick her up and take her outside ?
why do you say used to be your favorite restueraunt ?
oh no ! that is horrible ! did you get it back ?
"that is cool , was it nostalgic ?"
"oh no thats horrible . im glad i didnt see that , i wouldve been so upset"
"what time was it ? please becareful with these kinds of things , you were lucky and i am glad nothing happend , but people do not realise how dangerous it is at night , why were you out so late ?"
that sounds wonderful ! i bet it was amazing
that is very disgusting . i hope you complained !
"oh im so sorry , please do not worry , i know it is tough but i learned that death is only a beginning not the end"
"aww , im sorry . thats always hard"
"a road trip sounds fun , but i agree with you . i feel like i am a cab driver when people are on devices and not talking to me at all ."
"good luck with that , its rough out there ."
"that could be embarrassing , do you have a new partner ?"
did he finish it all ?
"oh god that is worse than thinking you lost your phone for a second , i am aware of the feeling , how are you feeling now"
did you try to find who the belonged to ?
"dang , that is a nice honor . shows you what he thinks of you . i would like someone to ask me to be their best man one day ! congratulations to the both of you"

"oh welcome to the long distance club ! i am exactly in the same situation as you , we are going on a cable car , we are going to meet in weeks and i also can not wait , i feel you , let s have a blast"
what happened ?
why was it amazing ?
thats really sad . im sorry to hear that . getting old stinks . i feel bad when i see someone who seems really lonely
"that really is something to get excited about ! i have never been outside of the country , so i am jealous of people that get the chance to . i hope you are able to get everything out of the trip that you want to"
"that sounds really annoying , i bet thats making a huge mess"
sorry to hear that . maybe your luck will turn around soon !
well if he was good at the trick its understandable . as long as you were a kid .
must be disappointing knowing the spark is not there .
im happy to hear that ! that is a big step and he needs as much support as possible !
that stinks i am sorry .
that is awesome ! what did they do ?
that is good ! always smart to be prepared !
"good for you , how did it turn out ?"
"that sucks , perhaps he should of be saving his money to pay for his apartment , instead of having two dogs ."
that sounds very depressing .

"that sucks , i imagine nothing ever became familiar to you ."

why inspired you to do that ?
sorry to hear that ! it must be infuriating to have that happen
that is awesome . where is your home ?

"oh my , how are you going to bathe and use the restroom ?"

"why are you angry , did you sister get unfairly fired ?"
good for you !
are you always alone ?
i can imagine . why do not you take a lyft or uber ?
that is great . is it his first year ?
"its definitely not fair . it seems almost as if people do not try to create a friendship or are playing both ends of the candle to see which bargain plans per friends are better , and then make a choice"
"sorry to hear that . my parents used to struggle with health issues too , and i would worry just as much as they would . do you know when it may be rescheduled for ?"

all you can do is prepare the best you can . after that there is not much else you can do .
"wow , you are sentimental i guess ! !"
oh yeah that is a really big step . have you guys talked about it yet
that sounds terrible ! what happened ?
"wow , that is a big inheritance . what do you plan to do with it ?"
that sucks ! did you have to go back for it ?

i feel you . i once stole drumsticks . i swear it is something about being a teenager .
"oh that sucks , getting sick is the worst . hope you feel better soon . take vitamin c , it really does help some people ."

"that is so nice of you . i have been in that place , where i needed help , and was incredibly grateful to those who helped . how did it make you feel ?"
"i do not have children yet , but hopefully in the future . as long as they are easy to handle ."
really . . old age is a part of our life . . better enjoy than feeling sad
i do agree . it seems like more and more people are going through rough times these days . nobody wants to do anything about it .
"oh that sounds so fun , do you have a black belt ?"
"i understand that , i do not even like going to the gym , because i feel like people are always watching me and it makes me feel awkward ."
oh no what happened once they got your information ?
i am sorry for your loss . how did he die if you do not mind me asking ?
i bet that was so scary for you ! did they find out what was wrong ?
nervous about the person or nervous that they will not take it ?
yikes ! that would be really scary ! ! i hope you did not get in the car !
that must have been so stressful . what did you do ?
"wow ! i hope it did not cause a lot of damage , i have a bunch of very tall trees in my yard as well ."
"oh i have done that , i hate when that happens . are you going to see them again soon ?"
"awww ! how sweet ! i love kittens , but it sounds like a lot of work !"
i hate that feeling . i spent on groceries i did not exactly need . so i know how you feel .
"could turn out good , could turn out bad . how well do you know your friend ?"
"oh that is good , you both must have had a very trusting relationship ."
"yea , sometimes we take those who care about us for granted ."
"that is understandable , no one knows your pets like you do ."
oh no ! i hope everything is ok ! was she mad ?
"that is so sweet . i love cats , but i am allergic to them so we can not have any . it makes me sad ."
what ? how ? is it ok now ?
"oh my god , that is horrible . i am really sorry to hear that . i hope you are doing okay ."
it is important to have faith that things will work out the way they should ! i am a strong believer in that !
you can always use and old mason jar wrapped in some hemp fiber
it is always a good thing to be able to focus on things that do not have to do with money .
you know sometimes it is hard to predict something like that
oh i am sorry to hear that but i am glad you have a good friend !
"exciting , what concert ?"
that is too bad . we always want to give our kids the things they want . i am sure he ll understnad
"oh that sounds nice , have you had trouble in the past staying committed ?"
i know exactly what you mean . it is really tough but when i make decisions i try to stand on them and be willing to pivot if necessary .
sometimes it can be true . do not be taken for a run
"congratulations , that sounds like things are moving along at a nice pace ."
how long has it been since you had your old dog ?
"i lost my job , so i know how you feel . it is tough not have a source of income ."
it is never to late to continue on that path or find a new one . same happened here .
"that is terrible . i do not know what is up with this world anymore , it seems like things are always getting worse ."
have you tried talking to them about this ?
did you hear anything about what happened at that camp in your absence ? i hope there were no hard feelings !
that is completely understandable . have you tried distracting yourself with hobbies or productive chores ?
"any ice cream on sale sounds like a good time to me . i have never heard of blue bell though , is it any good ?"
"oh no , that is such an awful thing for them to do . do your cats often ruin things in the household ?"
and is he okay with that ?
what happened to yours ?
dang that is a definite mood killer . at least you ve got a fix on the way .
well from what i have read we will all be drowning which is not good .
odd ! any idea where you went wrong ?
how old are they now ?
i am sorry to hear that . are you better now ?
"you guys sound like great grand kids , i bet she wholeheartedly appreciated it ."
sounds like fun ! did you enjoyed it ? how far did you go ?
why has your week been so busy ?
yikes ! that must have caught you off guard .
oh no ! did he take it okay ?
i am in the same boat . i am so happy to hear that and i hope you get the job !
are you excited for the new group ?
must be hard when you can not physically see what you are doing .
oh no that sucks ! what book ?
oh the nostalgia of watching old movies . what movie ?
i used to want to do that so bad when i was younger . was it amazing ?
that is a great goal to set for yourself . where do you work if i may ask ?
"it must be nice to have that kind of trust for someone , and motorcycles can be fun !"
"aw , i have been there , i bet you like it ! especially after you get used to it ."
that is terrifying ! i bet you did not sleep that night !
"ha ! are you a fan of horror movies now , or do you still find them scary ?"
"i am sorry to hear that , i hope it is only a temporarily situation and you will be on your feet in no time ."
wow that is so exciting ! i bet he s a nice guy in real life .
"oh no . maybe you can find one that is used , or even rebuilt . i got my car for less than what i would ve paid from a car dealer !"
"oh , i could do that if i did not have bad teeth and can not handle the cold . i would regret it if i did though because i really need to lose some weight ."
what happened ?
"well , you gave him the benefit of the doubt . it was his decision to cheat ."
that is kind of him ! is he good at that sort of thing ?
yes you would have more warranty kind of things with work from a dealership
that is awesome ! i wish someone in my family was so handy !
me too . old photos bring about such nostalgia .
"wow , that is such an honor . how do you feel about it ?"
i bet that whipped up a lot of feelings inside of you . i am sorry for your loss .
get away with what ?
did you get caught using them ? !
wow ! that is terrible ! maybe next time just get a tutor instead of cheating !
oh dear ! what happened ! ?
oh my goodness ! good for you for getting away from that trouble !
next day guilt when the fun is done . how awful . i wonder if they ll fess up .
how did that go ? do you like that ?
who was it with ?
what was it ? did everything turn out alright ?
that is terrible when friends fight . what was it over ?
that is got to be a tough phone call to make . did you two make amends or is she very upset ?
how interesting . how does that make you feel ?
"i felt the same way as you , but what is the point of keeping things you do not use and having it take up space ? do you use everything in your closet ?"
oh how sweet ! what did it say ?
i love finding treasures like that !
i hope that i am able to share such nice things with my own kids one day .
that is a lot of work ! but i bet the reunion will be fun .
"yum , i love making and also eating desserts ! do you have a specialty ?"
oh that is one of my faves . my go to is cheesecake .
is that like hospice care ? how do you deal with seeing loss so frequently ?
i am sure you do a great job of making these people feel cared for and loved in their final times .
i bet it is . thank you for giving your time to this type of work .
oh no ! i hate when i am hungry for something and it goes wrong like that !
the worst ! did you find something else to eat ?
that is exciting . is that something you want to do ?
"really , did you get to pick the movie ?"
"that is always nice , how did you respond ?"
"nice , jobs are ok , but a new ride is really fun . what did you get"
"wow , was it embarrassing ?"
"oh really , hopefully its a pretty nice job cause moving is not fun ."
as long as you are safe about it . you can meet up at police stations too !
wow . that is a long time . longer than i have been alive ! congrats on your successful marriage . got any tips ?
"ohhhh , that is so sad . i remember long ago when that happened to me . did he she live a good long life ?"
are you nervous ? or do you have amazing confidence in your ability ?
how old is your son ?
wow ! i enjoy watching overwatch on twitch occasionally . would you say that is your favorite game ?
that is awesome ! what did you have done ?
make sure to bring smores and bug spray . i hate bug bites . and love chocolate
oh i feel you ! every time i go back to stay with my family it feels . . . claustrophobic almost .
what is wrong with your tooth ? i hope it is not too painful of an experience .
that is awful . what are you going to do ?
interest are you going to try and get him to sell it ?
same . when you had one phone in the middle of the house with the super long phone cord so you could at least get around the corner to talk .
were you close to your wife s grandmother ?
that is very heartbreaking . im sure she had a very positive opinion of you as well .
those times seemed much simpler did not they ? do you ever break out of the routine ?
i see . how do you like playing the piano ?
awesome ! anything exciting on the horizon to treat yourself ?
well that stinks . what are they drilling for ?
oh no what happened ?
that is exciting and nerve wracking at the same time i bet . how do you feel about it ?
that can be tough but it also can be great to have time for yourself
oh that is exciting . are you nervous to have them over ?
aww that is so cute ! was it tough trying to get it to swim ?
that is so creepy and scary . what happened next ?
what for ? i hope it was not for anything dangerous .
yes i understand ! it is so hard to lose weight !
"ouch , that is unfortunate . hopefully it turned out okay though ?"
oh no ! did you get in trouble ?
sometimes when you are looking back at a situation you get a whole new perspective now that you are away from it . i am happy that you have that realization .
god s plan ! do you know why he did it ?
that is great ! such a satisfying feeling ! did you get a good grade ?
that is really good news . it must be frustrating to move from place to place constantly . is your family happy with the place ?
amen . what kind of dogs do yo have ?
aw little guys . do they walk well on the leash ?
that is about how mine is . he is a bit bigger so he pulls a little harder . i found using a harness has helped .
that sounds great ! are you excited ?
oh my goodness . that must have been traumatic to see . do you know what happened to the dog ?
i agree with that . i always try to give the benefit of the doubt at first .
oh man . bless your soul ! i bet that can test your patience .
i am glad it is over and nothing happened . do you have an underground shelter ?
are you excited ?
congratulations ! that is exciting . how long have you been waiting for this .
very cool . i wish you all the best .
i am a freelancer
oh no ! not the old pop on the rug trick . did you yell ?
what kind of dog ? i have a boston terrier . she s the cutest .
oh cute ! what a devil .
oh no ! did you have to go home and change ?
that is so cool ! im not married yet
aw that is tough ! have you talked to him about it ?
i hope it is a lot more than just a gift card but at least starbucks should be a lot of money because it is so expensive there !
i am sorry that must have been tough . she probably felt bad for you .
"ok , thats lovely"
"a point of what ? like , of land ?"
oh no ! that must have put you in a bad position . how did you handle it ?
hi friend who is too good to you ?
thats so cool of you
i know ! that must be frustrating . do you have enough money to cover it ?
i am sure it was scary to leave your kids for the time but at least it was their aunt and not a stranger !
"it does sound like fun , though . did you have a good time ?"
true . easier said than done though . how can we be ?
did you layer had the surgery ?
"oh , i am sorry to hear that ! that must have been upsetting ."
"oh i am so sorry , i am assuming the injury was serious ?"
has n t everyone done so at some point ?
"atleast it was not in class at a college or something , right ?"
oh my gosh that is so cute ! i bet they were the cutest .
"yes , but think of all the opportunities it can open up . do not let fear stop you !"
did she forget it at home or did she just not bother turning it in ?
oh no ! i bet you were so mad ! were you able to find something else to snack on ?
i am completely agree . how long have you been married ?
that sucks . i hate having scratched glasses
i am so sorry to hear that . i was together with my wife for years when she left me so i know your pain .
"yes , that is always a hard situation ."
"that is the best decision . i know mine would n t either . if he is a good guy , he will understand ."
it is definitely good to get that looked at right away . then they can take care of it !
nice ! did it help you become less stressed ?
scared of what
why is that ?
oh thats not good . . sometimes teenagers can be alittle messy
i think theme park rides are scary ! was it scary when you were stuck ?
"awww , you are speaking fondly on when he was young . is he not as nice anymore ?"
"i suppose , but research and concrete knowledge is more beneficial as it is a very hands on and physical occupation , especially when the health of others are in their hands ."
dogs are wonderful pets . they are so loving and devoted . what kind of dog do you have ?
all the time i am not sure i believe in god
that is pretty crazy you could of had your money and the care package too
"oh , i am so sorry ! i am an animal lover , too . we have two dogs now , but used to have cats , too . we did have to say goodbyes to some of our pets over years . it is heart breaking . . ."
was it a holiday ?
oh no ! that is so frustrating .
i am sure you were . was boot camp really hard
oh wow . i would hate that . what ended up being the issue ?
oh no how is she feeling now ?
what a bummer ! what place did you end up getting ?
did you get hurt or drown a bit ?
i sure hope the hot dog was fit to eat
that is really good you guys can trust eachother like that . that helps make you both grow in the relationship .
wow ! you do not see much of that anymore . so true .
where were you not invited to ?
"hey , were you injured ?"
aww that is so sweet . i completely understand why ! oh and thank you for your apology but i am truly content and have accepted it .
sounds like a fun one to me . are you happy there ?
who is that ?
thats always a good feeling . i bet you are excited to come home everyday .
what a good dog and full of joy !
i hope you have a good time and you enjoy it .
did you do it ? how far does he live from you ?
what happend ?
"they have n t called you back yet ? i hate when that happens , they make you wait by the phone on pins and needles !"
"do not let it break your confidence though , it just was not meant to be . i think you will land your next application though ."
oh my gosh ! have they broken it ? that would drive me nuts .
have you spoken to them personally ? maybe they should pay for you to move it !
"wow that sounds intriguing , what new things did you try ?"
"yeah , it is crazy how each year seems to go by faster than the last too , having kids must be surreal"
"wow , congrats , what did you end up naming him ?"
sounds exciting . i always wanted to leave my were i was originally from so i could experience and see new things
oh definitely . why did you ?
it is always fun to get new clothes ! is the wedding soon ?
sounds like a real hard decision . i would be very apprehensive as well .
that sounds like some good work experience . how long is he in .
that is the worst . i wonder if he was trying to prove something .
"congrats , how did you handle the pressure ?"
omg ! especially recently . a week seems like one day .
oh really ? are you a massage therapist ?
"i am good , what is up ?"
way to go ! if it makes you feel better i would be your friend if i was there
hope you did not take a bath after that
wow brazil ? is not there a lot of crime there ?
"that is good , how does that make you feel"
"nice , too bad i was not invited !"
no ! i think that should be on my bucket list though .
what are you waiting for ?
"thanks , you as well . i know how that is . give it time and things will get better ."
"aw , i know how that goes . do they visit often ?"
that does sound exciting ! why are you scared ?
"yeah i have one , but they are all over the place it seems like"
babies are pretty small and delicate they look like they might break at the slightest bump .
wow that would be terrible news . i can not imaged shit is taking it well .
"that is horrible , i am so sorry , it is hard losing a baby animal , you are not expecting them to pass , like when you have an older sickly one"
"that is crazy , i wonder what was wrong with it"
ahhhh thats amazing ! i stay home with my kids too ! how many kids do you have ?
"oh no , what happened ? did they do or say something ?"
"i am sorry , is it difficult to take care of her ?"
"hmm , how did that make you feel"
good to hear that you keep your word
at least that shows that you have a conscience . i hope that you made it up to them .
"wow , i am sure the veterans loved it ! what kind of treats did you and the kids bring to them ?"
wow that is some really early christmas shopping . you must like to plan ahead .
i love vegetable soup . so were you able to enjoy your nap ?
sounds like she has some underlying issues with trust . you may want to sort it all out before you get too involved .
that was nice of them . did you have any problems with their car ?
well at least you can trust him to be careful . i dont think i would be able to trust my nephew as he is only and not very responsible yet .
"that is so nice of you , i would have chased down the car , but you did the right thing"
what kind of job is it ? i will keep my fingers crossed he gets it !
"oh wow i am glad she was happy , why were you nervous ?"
boy o boy bet she is having the time of her life . how many vacations have you taken this year ?
"oh , no ! what happened ?"
were you able to get out of there without anybody noticing or did you die from embarssment ?
where you disappointed ?
where do you live ?
maybe go earlier later ?
". . . im sorry , how did it happen"
nice ! the married life is expensive
oh ! what happened ?
that sounds awful . who was it you wronged ?
i am sure you will be able to get another one fairly quickly !
do you think it is possible that he does still love you and also made a horrible mistake ?
"i think that when people cheat and lie , it is because something is wrong with them and not their partner . if he does not realize his mistake , then he does not deserve your love . i wish you all the best !"
what do you mean ?
"yes i do , that is why i only trust one person , my wife"
what happened to you ?
"awwe that is so sweet , how did you two meet ?"
mmm that sounds delicious . there is always time to make pancake tuesdays at home !
"i have n t , but it is definitely on my bucket list !"
i bet it helped having someone there who knew what they were doing .
i believe i was fifteen . i drove a soccer mom van !
oh no ! i would have been furious ! were you able to catch him ?
oh okay . . . . was that even a temptation to begin with ?
oh no that is awful ! it is against the law where i live to ban animals from the house . so legally i am allowed to have a pet even if the contract says no pets allowed .
"i am so sorry to hear that . i hope she ll be doing good , she is very lucky to have someone taking care of her ."
oh no ! hopefully you did not get too many nasty stares !
i have had a similar experience with a gossiping coworker . it made the workplace such an uncomfortable environment !
"wow that sure is a lot of stuffed animals , did you play with toys alot at a kid ?"
that is very exciting ! i am sure he put a lot of work towards that .
did you end up ending the friendship ?
oh that is definitely something to be excited about !
"that must have been so painful , do not get embarrassed it happens to everyone , people fart in public transports , people fall and rip their jeans , people cry over stupid things , it is a totally normal thing"
was that your idea ? why did you decide to do that ?
my condolences to you . will you be able to visit his gravesite ?
i hope that nothing came of it though .
great confidence ! what do you anticipate your grade to be
that is great ! good luck
why is that ?
i a so sorry to hear that . how are you coping with your loss ?
you sound prepared for it ! im sure you have practiced .
hey what is up ?
"oh no , that is terrible , what are you going to do ?"
that is great i always love to hear about happy couples . too much bad news in the world .
"hi there , how re you ?"
i know the feeling when you finally have your own place to do what you want .
why ? what did he do ?
i hope you do too . sounds like you did well preparing .
is your dog ok ?
what did you eat ?
"ah i know this feeling , how did the conversation go ?"
"you should n t be so attached to your old stuff , you might end up a hoarder !"
oh no . did you study for it ?
"what makes you so afraid of them ? they do eat all the other creepy crawlies , after all ."
oh no how did you feel ?
i usually stick with what i know also
that sounds awful . i hope he is better now !
oh no ! maybe you can get her a gift and some sweets to make up for it ?
"awesome , i bet you are with your puppy all the time now"
"i know what you mean , maybe ask if the place is hiring ?"
oh no ! i am sorry to hear that . i hope she gets better .
i can not imagine what that must have felt like . what helped you get through it ?
did you hear the you will be a ditch digger speech like my brother did ?
that does not sound like such a pleasurable memory . maybe you received a gift your brother always secretly wish he had !
"i am not afraid of clown myself , but i can absolutely see how they can be terrifying to some people !"
"that is awesome , can you tell me more about what you will be doing ?"
"wow , she must be a talented child ! i am sure you are so proud of her ."
congrats ! that is always a great feeling .
how did that turn out ?
haha we all did crazy things when we were young ! did you ever get caught ?
congratluations ! i bet your full of joy !
i bet ! have you gotten any word back yet ?
oh no ! how awkward ! did anyone see it ?
i am glad ! you must have a very good veterinarian
oh my goodness ! is she going to be alright ?
that is wonderful . what is your dogs name ?
do you at least enjoy the new job ?
that sounds awesome . a lot of people would kill to have a cooperative work environment . i bet it increases performance as well .
i hope that business goes well !
why years ? that is a very specific time ago .
it should be fun ! do you like baseball ?
"that is terrible , you had no clue it was coming ?"
how long did it take you ? that is amazing .
my husband owns a business and its also stressful . what kind of business did yall start ?
at least you are comfortable and enjoying that ! some people would hate being alone .
hi ! tell me something about yourself !
oh wow ! did she notice ?
how did you feel when you eventually found out that she know ?
im sorry to hear that . i know that can be stressful .
im sorry . i can imagine how you felt ! hopefully you hit a home run !
i totally understand what you mean . peace and quiet is nice but i bet you miss your son when he is gone ?
wow that is a lot of people ! what were you doing on stage ?
"so sorry to hear that , hard to be alone ."
"wow , tell me about it"
are you friends with your neighbor
oh no that does not sound good . what almost happened ?
"oh , dont take it so hard , its always like that , so sorry about that"
what were you trying to do ?
oh absolutely . that is the worst feeling . who hurt you and how are you doing now ?
ah . i can imagine i have been in a similar situation . but just remember he loves you and if he s never given you any doubt then trust him
"wow , that must be do disgusting"
did you fix it so that they will not lose their property in the future ?
i hope you are right .
why is that
why is that ?
"that is the thing with accusations , anybody can say anything . but if they do not have any proof then it is meaningless ."
"ok , calm down , take a deep breath and relax"
that sounds pretty nerve wracking . how did it go ?
"that is positive , you must really love her !"
"appearance is important , what is more important is how you look on the inside !"
dealing with kids can be like that . is there something about doing his hair that he is scared of ?
yuck ! i am so afraid of spiders . were you able to squash it ?
that is so much trust ! i hope she does not let you down !
"why ? the sun is going to engulf the earth in a few billions years . and even before that , the y chromosome in humans is going to die out and our civilization will end ."
did it feel nostalgic ?
that is very nice of you . i feel the same way about my husband . is not it nice to care about someone ?
how much you trust him ?
what was it that made you so proud of him ?
i have . have you ?
oh no ! how old was he ? i am so sorry losing a pet is so hard .
"yep i have a cat . he s really sweet , and totally worth it . but it all depends on what kind of animal you get"
"oh wow , that is a huge step ! are you nervous ?"
oh no that must have been so embarrassing . were you injured at all ?
that must ve been very disapointing
"that is fantastic ! have you been working extra hard to earn it all , or did it come to you some other way ?"
wow ! i am really happy for you that must be such a great feeling of peace .
what color did it end up being ?
what is wrong ?
why do not you think it will be a good fit ? you might be underestimating yourself
oh no ! that must have been really embarrassing ! how did you respond ?
i do not blame you . that was so rude of her to make that comment in front of everyone .
does that at least inspire you to improve your abilities ?
have you ever knew some that got to do everything you wanted to but could not ? well have and its not fun .
how did that make you feel ?
oh that is not good . what did you do ?
oh wow . i know being away from our loved ones can make it hard to sleep . have you tried to listen to nature sounds ? i have an app on my phone and i play rain sounds to help me sleep .
what kind of job is it for ?
did you have fun ?
you sound very grateful .
"well , hopefully you will enjoy it while you are here !"
that is nice . i wish i had people like that to work with
i wonder if he has a crush on you or wants something in return
did it boost your confidence and faith in mankind ?
"i am sorry to hear that . did they give you a severance package ? also , do you have prospects for a future position ?"
at least they did that much for you . i am sure you will land on your feet . you seem like an optimistic type
that is wonderful ! i hope you find fulfillment and a sense of purpose not to mention a chunky wallet haha
did it make you nostalgic ?
"i know what you mean , life gets more complicated as you get older"
"oh i see , what happens then ?"
what were you expecting ?
"thats so good , am happy for you"
did he notice ? that would have been embarrassing .
"that is terrible , family should never betray each othey"
do not be sad it ll be okay
well you should be happy for them !
hope they were bad ones
that is great you should always feel confident in yourself . what is your project ?
"wow , like seriously . why the show off ?"
i hope she gets better . it must be very hard seeing loved ones in sickness .
"that is annoying , did you call him after he did not turn up ?"
"oh , i am sorry . everyone makes mistakes sometimes ."
there are so many things that come out at night . what are you referring to ?
thats so good of them
that sounds frustrating . did you drop anything else ?
"oh no , i am sorry to hear that . with five kids , that has happened to me multiple times . i can commiserate !"
"if you were unhappy , sometimes you just have to make that leap . now you can explore your options !"
"ah , that is lovely ! i have such fond memories of running around in parks as a child . i do not think young people today really understand the value of just running around and playing ."
"i am glad you did not no one deserves to be cheated on , it is the most distusting and stupid thing anyone can do"
and did you pass your exam ?
"wow , what happened ?"
"that is nice , what did she say tho"
"do not force people to do anything , you need to show respect"
being able to enjoy your workplace is worth it . you are lucky to be in that position
wait untill its done
who always made you proud ?
change is always difficult . how do you feel about it now that you have made the transition ?
me too
and what were the results ? did you win ?
oh i am sorry . try to relax if you can .
"yeah it scares me to think about that sometimes , too . what in particular do you fear could happen ?"
i would be careful . there is a lot of unrest in the world right now .
that is annoying when that happens . did you ask for your money back ?
that is exciting ! did they come ?
that sounds good . i wish i could have some !
maggots are so disgusting ! had the trash been sitting for awhile ?
"lol , exactly , because they are children"
that is always a nice thing . in charge of what ?
oooh no thats was so bad
that is so disgusting ! i hope you did not have to pay your bill !
"oh , that is cute ! how did that work out for you ?"
what happend ?
"oh god , what did you end up doing ?"
oh no ! what happened ?
how did they do that ?
why do you keep decieving yourself ?
kids grow up so quickly ! did you feel nervous about it ?
"that happens to me sometimes , too . i feel awful after !"
"oh , it sounds like fun ! i am sure you would have a great time ."
that is awesome ! are you going to go on the date with them ?
it was difficult for you
aww that is great to hear ! it sounds like she is your perfect match . how did you meet ?
oh man you must be really intelligent to test for mensa ! i bet it was difficult !
why ? what did you lie about ?
what
i hoe you made it there . getting lost sucks !
"wow . that is very interesting . these days , many people get married later in life . congratulations !"
"oh no that is so sad , i also have a cat but she is in her early days"
i know how you feel that would gross me out too . makes me feel like whoever prepared my food was not very clean .
which way is that ?
can you tell me the name of the book ? i find myself being engaged by a lot of novels these days .
it is insane how youtube and the internet overall are so helpful !
im sorry to hear that . tell me a fond memory you have of him her .
it is terrible when people can not take no for an answer . did you report her ?
i think you do not like cats very much . . .
oh i am really sorry to hear that . has he been looking for another job ?
that sounds exciting ? did you get in to the club ?
thats good because you prepared for it
who does and that is mean of them .
"wow , years . accept my condolence please"
maybe it is time to clear your conscience so you will not have to feel so bad anymore .
"same , do not know what i would do without them ."
i am so sorry ! that is awful ! did you get his insurance information ?
is there anyone else you can talk to ? maybe even human resources ?
what a lovely gift . i am sure that you will always treasure it because it came from him .
"wow , that was not cool at all"
that must feel amazing ! what did you do to deserve the recognition ?
"thats good , it feels good"
i ll bet that was scary . i would have run too .
"wow , that is great news . i love that"
i would have felt the same way . i am really afraid to get on any roller coaster . how was it ?
what kind of things did you all like to do ? sounds like it was fun to catch up .
i do . i have one and another one on the way . they can be gross little critters !
"wow , exciting ! is this going to be your friend s first child ?"
that is a pleasant surprise ! is this out of the ordinary ?
"wow , i have never done fishing , so how is it like"
what type of present was it ? it must have been pretty special .
"you did so well , have you given them names ?"
holy crap ! can it be remedied ?
i bet it felt good though ? that is good that you are happily married !
oh yeah ? did you get it worked out ?
"oh no , that is not cool . what happened ?"
"wow , that sounds exciting ! i hope everything works out for you !"
that is horrible . have you any idea what might have caused it ?
that is one of the most responsible things you can do . i am sure your family is proud of you .
that must have been devastating . did it take you a long time to find a new position ?
that is very hard . i lost my uncle in january and it is so hard to think about .

how old did you turn ? i hope you guys had some cake too !
"so sorry about that , she will be found"
i am so sorry to hear that . what can i do to help ?
"perhaps you could see a counselor or therapist , that might help ."
oh that is too bad . there are many free programs that you might be able to access .
"oh wow , that is wonderful . is it a girl or boy ?"
congratulations ! babies are amazing . i have two of my own . do you have any of your own ?
"it is a wonderful feeling , to be a parent . fingers crossed , you will be next ."
"aww ! babies are so much fun ! i have a new granddaughter , so i can relate !"
wow that must have been so hard to do ! i am so proud of you worker how do you feel ?
are you talking about me or someone else ?
she sings so well
who was she because she sounds special ? someone close to you ?
do you know what kind of car you want to get ?
"wow ! that is so nice of him , what did he make ?"
what really happened ?
oh no . what happened ?
did he try to help you up ? i have always wanted to see seattle !
that is wonderful ! it is a lot of work learning to cook .
"oh , that is rough . i bet that ruined them , did not it ?"
"exactly , that feels nice"
that is amazing . there are not a lot of people that can say that .
i am sure he feels the same way about you ! how long have you two been married ?
i am sorry to hear that . sometimes life gets in the way and we forget what is the most important to us .
that is a hard stage of life that i am not looking forward to ! do you get to talk to her often ?
do you still have the blanket ? that is an amazing gift from a wonderful part of your family .
i hope you are recovering well enough ! that is absolutely devastating news to read .
"oh , you should n t feel bad ! everyone gets sick every once in a while and i would hope that your boss and coworkers were very understanding of your needs . it is important to take care of yourself ."
oh crap ! that is not good !
that is nice of her !
that is really good and will be helpful . i lost my wife to cancer years ago and people helping was great .
i would encourage you to help as much as possible . i do the same now since i know what loss feels like .
i have always had a great church family . my aunt s church was pivotal in showing me how to be the best i could be and developing my character .
"oh wow , i am glad the vet was able to do that . it must have been scary ."
"oh , that was wonderful of you ! everyone needs a friend like you who understands that emotional support is very important !"
"i am sorry , i know that must make you sad and stressed . i have a daughter who lives pretty far away too"
"we talk every week and text all the time . it is hard , but i know she s happy so that is all that counts . thats great she found a good job"
"we have never facetimed , but that is such a good idea . especially now that she has kids . why have i never thought of that lol"
"i am so sorry to hear about your mom , but it is great that you had such support to help you through ."
"i am sorry to hear that , you must miss them . why have n t you been able to visit them ?"
that is awesome ! i close on my first house monday !
"oh wow , that is super embarrassing . did anyone take a picture ?"
"that is good , i imagine that all surgeries can be stressful ."
sounds like you made the right call
did it take a long time to complete ?
"i can certainly relate to you , it could be a safety hazard ."
i agree . do you find yourself in that situation right now ?
that is very kind of you to be so considerate . hopefully the right choice will make itself obvious to you in the near future .
"great , i hope you get it ."
"oh no , do what ?"
that is great ! are you doing it yourself or are you hiring someone to help you out ?
i am sorry to hear that ! maybe you can find a local club so you can meet people with similar interests !
"oh no , what was wrong ?"
oh no ! that had to be frustrating . i hope it was not too close to closing .
"oh no . i am so sorry . i totally understand how you feel . mine passed away a few years ago , it is very difficult"
oh my goodness ! i did that after swimming one day . i was so busy getting the kids dressed that i forgot to clean my face . black mascara all down my cheeks .
were there other parents there ? i think that anyone who has kids would understand .
i can understand being humiliated in the moment . thankfully most kids grow out of that phase !
"oh , i am sorry to hear that ! it can be tough when we feel that we have lost face in front of others ."
i am sorry to hear that . i hope your financial situation improves in the future .
oh wow ! how did it go ?
"i am sure you did great ! i would be a ball of nerves too , though ."
were they from when you were a kid ?
oh no ! does he do that a lot ?
"oh , i am sorry to hear that . losing a family member is so hard ."
what was a good move ?
hey a similar thing happened to me ! i hope no one saw !
that must have been messy . were you able to get it all cleaned up ?
wow that definitely sounds like a crazy situation !
that is really interesting . what were they in prison for ?
did you leave the old place damged
yikes ! i hope it had n t ruptured already . is she okay ?
really ? did you avoid eating them ?
"oh , i know that feeling ! did you end up going on the ride ?"
is your student ok ? ? i am so sorry about that !
that must have brought back a lot of memories .
"oh no , what happened ?"
did you have a nice summer break ? are you excited for school to start back up ?
some people are too nosy . what did you say to them ?
that must have been upsetting . were you able to get it fixed ?
"counting down the days , eh ? how was your summer ?"
wow . did she know who you were ?
do you like her boyfriend ?
that sounds adorable ! what type of puppy is it ?
oh no ! were you able to find him ever ?
i hope you are coming back into a great school . i am sure the kids will be excited to see you .
i am glad that she s starting to feel better .
oh man that is amazing ! how much was it ? i hope they share .
"i am a teacher , so it is the opposite for me . my relaxing time is about to end ."
what caused you to be freaked out over the finished basement ? sounds good all around .
was it really nice out ? i love being able to go out and just listen to the sounds of the outdoors .
thats s great ! i bet he s been working really hard .
what was the movie ? i am always looking for something new to watch with my kids !
i would have been nervous too . did you find out if you got the job ?
"wow , that must of been a trip . how did it make you feel ?"
i think many children including myself stole things before they were taught it was wrong to steel .
that sounds really great ! do you like them as much as you remembered ?
"oh no , i am sorry to hear that . do they have any idea what the cause may be yet ?"
i totally know how you feel . i have kids and they were a handful as toddlers .
"i am sorry to hear that , are you alright ?"
that is cool . are you a big fan of her ?
"oh that sucks , i hate seeing friends and family injured or sick . that is very nice of you though that you stayed there with him , youre a good friend ."
oh i know the feeling ! i had the same affinity for swimming . my mom said i should give it a try . at first i did not want to but as i got better i started to love it .
i had a similar experience playiing little league baseball . how is your daughter feeling about it so far ?
that sounds relaxing ! quality alone time is important in a relationship
"oh no , i had a older cousin who did that to me as well . hopefully she was just giving you tough love or discipline ."
"when you tripped over the branch , did you get hurt ?"
"yeah it really is not for everyone , i like my alone time but only for a while . afterwards i feel alone and wanting to talk to someone ."
"yeah , i probably would have to leave someone at home with the baby ."
i bet it felt good to conquer the fear ! would you skydive again ?
"yes , he is good for finding answers we can not find ourselves ."
"nice , it is been a while since i have anticipated any new games . what game is it ?"
that sounds horrible . i would be so mad at them .
sounds fair . how hungry are you right now ?
"wow what a find , cherish that quilt and keep it safe from harm !"
"oh damn , that sucks . have you guys talked or did you immediately cut him off ?"
"i get where you are coming from , my mom supports both of my sisters . it can make you feel less important . hopefully you are getting along though ?"
did you and joe do well ?
that is reasonable considering how new stuff always looks great and how more fancy stuff may be available and cheap compared to when you made yours .
"yes , it is annoying ! people should put more thoughts into it before they decide to be so opinionated . . ."
wow ! that is a huge move ! how long ago was that and are things going well ? do you miss hawaii ?
tell me about it . both of my best friends moved several states away from me .
were you able to get it fixed ? things break at the most inopportune times !
"oh my , did you get a sugar rush after that ? your dentist must love you ."
oh no ! that is awful . that could be dangerous too !
i bet your neighbor was very appreciative of all of your help . that would have been a daunting task for the elderly neighbor .
wow ! do you think whoever inspected it missed something or ?
i bet . i would n t want to get stuck with a money pit either . i hope your state has a lemon law .
what an exciting time ! how s he doing with it so far ?
oh that is awesome ! i am an only child but i bet it is so cool to watch your siblings grow up like that .
ugh ! you must have a lot of books !
wow ! congratulations ! that sounds like a wonderful thing to do . was it just the two of you ?
"were you jittery at all ? i know i was when i was getting ready for mine ,"
uh oh . dealing with bad neighbors is just the worst ! do you think he d be mad if you asked him to fix the fence ?
"well , at least he knew what he was getting into right from the start lol ."
"nice , got ta be prepared . hope the party went well ."
do not give up ! you will find a better place and it will be the perfect fit .
how was the response to your ad ? did you get rid of everything you wanted to ?
what kind of things did she give you ? were they things that you asked for before ?
"aw , that is so sweet . i am guessing you and your brother were close ?"
"oh , no ! that is awful ! are you still in pain ?"
"i understand that , going through those albums can really make you think about how peaceful things used to be ."
"that is awesome , what great news ! i am sure your friend was really frightened at the prospect of cancer ."
i think we all do that with our siblings . i am sure he knows you still enjoy spending time with him anyway .
oh i have been there ! so much fun !
"oh my god , i bet you were grossed out but laughing at the same time ."
"congratulations , that is so exciting ! ! ! i know we should only hope for healthy but i ll keep my fingers crossed for pink"
"wow , that was very generous and courageous for her ! how are they now ?"
you need to rest to the competition
"well as a fellow human being , i agree that when parents care for their children , it creates a lifelasting bond between the two parties ."
oh nice ! that is exciting ! what kind of car did you get ?
"yikes , that is a scary situation to be in . i am glad the officer was able to help you ."
thats not good did you aplly for any other jobs ?
that is awful ! i hope you feel better soon .
that is so wonderful ! i have children myself and i love having grandparents to rely on .
i definitely do not ! i had a horrible experience the one time i used a hired babysitter and now i only leave my little ones with family .
oh no ! i hope no one got in trouble !
well that sucks . i hate it when animals are abandoned .
that is great news . i think you just might be nervous . they would n t have promoted you if you could not do it .
what do you guys do for work ? you sound like doctors
i am so sorry to hear that . are you feeling nauseated ?
you are not grossing me out at all . i am a paramedic firefighter so it takes alot to get me squirming . i hope you feel better . drink lots of gatorade and water to rehydrate so you do not feel awful tomorrow and try to get your hands on some zofran for the nausea .
big change ! both big cities though right ? i have always wanted to see that shiny bean thing in chicago .
woah i hope no one was hurt
"ew , that is really disturbing . the sight of cockroaches always gives me the willies ."
"oh , that must be nerve wracking !"
patience is not always a virtue that i am good with either . you should feel confident in your work !
uh oh . do you think she will be mad when she finds out ?
that must be a heart warming reunion to see your old patience
"oh no , did they disappear for good , or did someone turn them in ?"
that would be so scary . i actually left my credit card at a restaurant yesterday . thankfully they held onto it for me .
wow ! so have you tried any methods to get them back on track ? someone might have advice on youtube .
oh no that would make him quite young . i am so sorry ! do you have plans for another one when you are ready ?
"aww , that is good ! it is nice to have to someone you can do that with"
ahh that is so anxiety making . i hope he gets the jon .
"oh , that is a terrible problem ! that is the only time i do not envy homeowners ! i could not afford that at all ."
"it is great you have a college fund though ! my kids are very young , we have n t started that yet . although , we probably should . how long have you ahd yours ?"
i can see why it was hard to quit ! do you like your job now ?
"that is an amazing feeling . i have three daughters . it does not matter how many you have , the first time you hold them , its amazing ."
"that is awesome . i would love to have a boy too , but i am not sure if i want another one or not ."
"my youngest is , and almost completely potty trained , but its been a struggle . maybe when she starts school , i ll make up my mind ."
that was really nice of you ! i am sure they appreciated the gesture .
fantastic ! why kind of story is it ?
yikes ! did you figure out what it was ?
did you have to move there for a job ?
"oh , that sounds scary ! did you find out what it was ?"
"wow , that is a lot of people ."
"oh boy , i hope he is careful with your car"
i would have been so scared ! i do not understand having dogs off leash .
ouch ! kids have a tendency to learn things the hard way . was he okay ?
i am sorry . they grow up fast . its hard to watch them leave the nest .
"that sounds cool , but also too good to be true . i hope it is true though"
no i have n t . you are such a great person ! i wish to have grandchildren like you someday .
oh no ! were you able to come up with something else to say ?
tough ! are you planning on getting it fixed ?
"wow , you are a lucky man ! good to have a psychologist in the family too ."
"wow ! that must have taken a lot of guts , but i hope it was worthwhile ."
that is probably for the best you dont want to get involved with that stuff
"oh my ! well , i bet he quit making fun of you in light of his own embarrassment ."
that sounds difficult . did you try talking to people in your neighborhood ?
did you get the money back quickly ?
oh wow ! that really sounds like your brother is going through a rough time .
oh that is so sweet ! i love baby kittens . are you going to keep it ?
that is nerve wracking . i have kids myself so i know what its like .
that is an incredible act of kindness for a stranger . did they return the tool ? was the tool in normal shape when you got it back ?
that is so awesome ! did they come back and say something to you ?
"are you able to voice your opinions at least , and are heard ?"
"ah , that is terrible ! i guess it was their fault ? what did you do ?"
that is awesome . friends are great for support ! how did they help ?
i love football too ! i even catch a lot of the preseason . this is one of the best times of the year . who are you rooting for ?
"ahh , do you still have friends there ?"
maybe you can visit them more often because you like it there so much .
there is a korean restaurant by my house that i have been thinking of trying . i have never had korean food .
oh no that is terrible ! are you okay ?
i hate it when that happens ! i feel your pain . have you r tried tracking the package online ?

oh yes you can . just keep turking and you will get there for sure even if you have to work extra hours in the night .
i promise it is possible if you really want it . show me how bad you want it ! !
that is great that you were able to anticipate his needs . i try to do the same for my husband .
that was a nice thing to do . it is always good to be kind to others .
what did you do ?
that is good ! you should always do that
nice ! that must be so much fun to see all that stuff again . maybe they are collectors items now .
why ? did he do something erratic or dangerous ?
thats a good movie ! so many classic themes from that area . how did it make you feel ?
sports fan are you ! i have lost many bets honey do challenges to my football team as well ! i hope you feel better .
that is good is he a sweet dog ?
i sure you will do well if you are already studying . what subject is it ?

"wow that must be gross , i know it would make me feel like throwing up too"
thats not neighborly of them . i would be upset too
yeah i think everyone has
did you think a ghoul or monster were in there ? i had similar fears growing up .
what did you do to get over the fear ?
have you set up cameras to monitor the property ?
i used to do the same thing when i went on long trips . i would also bring extra things like blankets if it was winter .
that is horrible ! why would he do something like that ? ? ? did you do anything to stop him ?
that is terrible ! did you call and tell management ?
oh no ! i hate when that happens . happens to me all the time . did he forgive you ?
"that sounded like an ambitious endeavor , you must have felt sick afterwards"
that sounds really good right about now !
man i bet you were devastated did you lose anything else ?
omg ! that is insane . how did you react ?
"that sounds wonderful ! time flies , does not it ?"
i bet you were terrified ! did everything turn out okay ?
awww . i remember the first time i left my son with the babysitter . so many emotions . how old is he ?
that is wonderful ! do they feel the same way ?
manhattan would be a great place to live . you will love it there
yes several times . i usually just end up cutting the hair shorter to get over it .
"i bet , i am sorry you got one . all i can recommend is cutting it shorter and let it grow back out . or find a cool hat ."
yeah it is a solid art for sure .
whitewater rafting seems like alot of fun .
dude ! that sucks ! i am so sorry about that . what happened ?

wow that must be scary to have someone break into your house
"oh my gosh , did you actually lose the card ?"

"that sounds great , what did your dog do ?"

i love peaceful moments while relaxing . i bet that moment was much needed . i really like nature too
"oh , i can not wait to hear !"
are we ?
oh dang that sounds really scary . i am assuming that since you are still here that you are okay ?
"oh man , i hate it when my dog starts barking at the neighbor dogs too . i would be so mad at him for getting out though ."
"omg my current dog does that sometimes . she pukes up bile if she does not eat , so i always have to make sure she is eating her food ."

"i only used to watch rugrats , and i still can not stand that show . it was like the decline of the nick lineup ."
"wednesdays , why is that ? i used to love wednesdays because we always got out of school an hour early"
"aw , why is that ?"
"probably not , but i do not remember . i was always a scaredy cat as a baby . have you ?"
that is not good what happened ?
"that happened my freshman year with my best friend . it really sucks at first , but eventually you get used to it ."
what is happening tomorrow night ?
"did you ever get your own snowboard ? it looks like so much fun ! i see people on tv , where they are flying off mountain sides !"
"oh wow , letting the dog roam free even when it is so new to the neighborhood ? that seems like recipe for disaster . your poor newspaper . ."

"do tell , what happened was it bad ?"
"oh no , were you able to find your dog again ?"
how did that work out ?
i would not of been happy with that were you ?

i have had an experience like that . i do believe in ghosts .
ghosts ?
ugh that is no fun especially with it being so cold .
wow . what for ? had you recently talked to her ?
aww ! what for ?
"friends really are the best part of life , i would say . i can not imagine what i would do without some of those folks in my life ."
"oh no , did he place the blame on you , or did he just accept it and take the blame for you ?"
oh that is awesome . do you like her ?
that is good ! cheating is not good for a relationship .
i can not imagine . where from ?
i understand . i have had to do that before . my family was very giving .
good for you ! i am glad you were able to face it by yourself . where were you flying ?
cool ! was that your first time flying by yourself ?
"wow , that is amazing ! did you enjoy the flight back or were you still scared ?"
"no , i have n t . i have heard of it , though . what is it about ?"
i would think that being an only child would be somewhat boring and lonely . how bad can it be with your brother ?
"wow , did anyone see ?"
oh no ! how so ?
why would they do that ?
"wow , hope it was not serious ."
why did not you perform well ?
that must have really hurt . when did you realize he was always lying to you ?
what was the lie ?
i am so sorry . that is horrific .
i had never visited there . but it reminds me of athenas and that old cities
do u remember the name of that island ?
i would like to visit it one day too
"aw , that is really sweet of him . what did the note say ?"

it is always good to unwind after a tough day . how did you celebrate ?
"erm . well , i hope that comes true for you . betting better can sometimes be more about believing it . maybe your cat believe he is fine ."
good .
"oh shoot , why is that ?"
how d they react ?
"oh no , what happened ?"
"oh , do you think you did well ?"
have you ever kept secrets from her ?

it is good that your wife trusts you
that is extremely noble of you ! you did the right thing ! !
what did you do ?
"dang , was it from craigslist ?"
dang ! what kind of games did you play ?
"praying will not do anything , but did you study well ?"
did he exceed your expectations ?
family is one of the most important things to have in life .
yes i do
"yes , hurricane harvey destroyed my city !"
"i bet you are , so did she just purchase a new house ?"
wow that is a significant amount of time ! how has that been for you ?
oh my ! i hope that he did not feel badly about it . that sort of thing is normal for children
that is amazing ! a parent will always love their children regardless of past decisions . how did you find her ?
"no . i have kids , but they are toddlers ."
"i bet that makes you angry , mine use to do the same thing and it made me furious ."
what ! ? what is going on ?
why ? did he do something terrible ?
dang ! do you look like your parents ?
financial stress can be a major burden . how did you get over this issue ?
that is a smart and well thought out plan
would you be able to forgive her for such a large mistake ?
i can understand that . it took me many years before i learned to have complete faith in my wife .
"the only thing i can tell you is to have faith in her judgement . if you ever lose it , it is time to cut your losses and run because it will only lead to hurt and ruin ."
does your boss call on you a lot ?
that is really kind of you . what good customer service !
wow that is impressive ! how long did you train for it ?
oh no ! did you get hurt ?
that is scary ! i am glad you played it safe and decided to stop ! there is always another marathon to run !
wow ! did you punish him or anything ?
"why , that is not good"
result for what
"nope , it is too scary for me !"
"ah i was never much of a sports guy , but i do work out a lot . do you still play ?"
and now they are rattled around by lb guys smashing into you
haha yeah . i am worried about hurting myself by working out too hard
what is that ?
congrats ! ! ! ! it is an amazing experience ! i just had a little baby girl weeks ago
take it one day at a time man . it is a truly amazing thing . you will love that baby with all your heart
wow what kind of exams are you taking ?
that is very trusting . did they come back with the milk ?
good for them . nice to know that there are good people left in the world
sometimes it can get tricky when family and money are involved . did he pay you back ?
what d he do ?
who did he bit
wow congrats ! is it a boy or a girl ?
i hope there was a good reason for that !
maybe you should talk face to face with him next time you see him .
i talked with my boss recently because i thought he was angry at me but it turned out he was just having problems at home .
why ? what is in that room ?
really ? have you watched any zombie movies or shows lately ?
cute ! ! ! what did you name it ?
i find them creepy too . i am actually very scared of them .

is it just temporary ?
"oh dear , that must ve been embarrassing , are you okay though ?"
"girl , you are so lucky . you got a good one . better things are on the way for you ."
"it is nice to have someone who can help you always , i am pretty sure she loves having you by her side always"
that is too bad . i can not have dogs in my apartment either . why will not they let you have one ?
"ah , that is so exciting ! is he looking forward to it ?"
do they have any sentimental value for you ?
"wow , did you fall on your butt that hard ?"
why are you scared of leaving your current job ? if you have been offered a better job then just leave you know ?
what made it hectic ?
what happened ?
what about the cats though ?
what have you eaten ?
what happened ?
at least you have a wife . probably would if it were not for fights over dumb things .
did you feel scared ?
"uhmnnn , you really did ?"
it is always good to have a boss you can get along with . it makes work a lot less stressful .
the morning dew and the rising sun
your friend is probably one of the luckiest people on earth . how do you feel about it
of course i would
oh i hate group work for that exact reason . i would rather just have company while i did the work
i am so sorry to hear about your dog . what happened to him ?
i am pretty sure they were more than happy to help you because they are your parents in the end .
you are so hyped for the day . i wish that will be the same for me .
mind telling me what happened maybe i could help you ?
"that is great . i never did a long distance one . but my brother did , and it was about miles ."
good for you . where have you been ?
what d you do there ?
that is a good idea !
"great , what happend ?"
sounds like a good adventure ! where are you going to climb ?
i hope it turned out great . did you find a good hairdresser to do your hair ?
"oh i am so sorry to hear that , how long have they been gone ."
that must have been embarrassing . did the girls get in trouble for it ?
did she punish you ?
that is terrible . hopefully things right themselves for you soon .
was the guitar okay ?
holy cow ! why did she go to jail ?
"woah , i never had that happen to me ."
i am sure that was difficult . how is he now ?
how did the school feel about it ? do not they have strict rules about that ?
"wow , that would have scared me , how did it go ?"
"that is a really big change , are you nervous ?"
if you regret what you did you should go apologise for you said to him !
you will need to be careful around me then . i am the type of person who takes advantage of people
why ? what is happening today ?
"oh , my goodness . i really hope you are right and that the results come out negative ."
thats amazing . where was the concert ? and how many people were participated ?
did he came back to take it ?
"i think a lot of people feel the same , it is natural . is there anything in particular that you are scared of happening ?"
i am sorry about that . what did he do ?
well i mean . . . does she really ? or do you just think she does
"that is great , what kind of job was it ?"
that is really interesting . do you think it benefits them learning from you rather than qualified teachers ?
"i see , being alone can be fulfilling to . it all depends on the kind of person you are ."
why ? i had the same thing happening to me with my dog . is she somewhere safe though ?
"that is amazing , it is always nice to get on with your family ! have you always got on with them ?"
"well , if you provided for your child s care then you should n t feel bad . i mean , this is not the dark ages ."
that is so good . how old is she ?
that is really nice it is always amazing to have friends who you feel comfortable around . what was the new thing your friend made you do ?
"do you hate when anybody tells you what to do , or just figures of authority ?"
"i think if you are confident in yourself , you can talk yourself into most jobs . you should give yourself more credit and not say you were lucky !"
"i am so jealous , i would eat pizza every day if i could ! what is your favourite pizza ?"
i am sorry to hear that . what are you studying ?
that is an amazing attitude . not many people are like that nowadays .
"oh wow , was in unprovoked ?"
"you must be having bitter , sweet emotion . i remember my mom was also emotional when i left boarding school for the first time ."
i am sorry to hear that . did you apologize ?
what happened ?
that is extremely loyal ! you must have a really happy relationship ?
that is so nice of you . hardwork pays
that is so nice . who was it from ?
oh no ! that is awkward . are you able to laugh about it now ?
"oh , maybe that is a sign to bring fun and adventure in your relationship ?"
"that is such a shame ! were you honest with your friend , and did they forgive you ?"
"if she is that good a friend , i am sure she ll forgive you soon enough ."
oh i am so sorry . losing a pet is never an easy thing .
"skydiving is insane to me , how did it go ? what reminded you of it ?"
"that is incredibly sad , i am so sorry for your loss . how long had you had your dog ?"
"oh , no ! what caused so many innocent deaths ?"
did they anything mean to you ?
how did you get into this situation ?
well i think she should be the one to get you out of it ! otherwise perhaps you could see a financial adviser . they might be able to help you consolidate your debts
well i have never heard of god helping with financial situations but perhaps if you pray and scrape together enough money for a ticket to las vegas all your troubles will be gone
wow ! some delivery driver must be excited about their latest acquisition !

"oh god , that sounds horrifying , are you and your family okay ?"
"oh , my goodness ! are you and your family safe though ?"
"well , shes your wife after all"
"oh amazing ! how long were you training for , and how many people did you beat ?"
"aaawww , i am sorry you had to go through that"

"that is cool , a good relationship is based on trust"
i like food . what kind ?
aw that is very kind of you . i love morning coffee !
oh no . how bad was it ?
"is it because you are surrounded by people most of the time ? i get that way sometimes too , so i can relate ."
that sounds like so much fun ! were you scared ?
yuck ! at least the cockroach is not in your kitchen anymore ! my cats like to catch mice and bring them to the front door .
oh i bet that is frustrating ! can you report it to someone ?
what kind of vacuum is it ? i bought a dyson recently and i love it !
that is so sweet literately . he seems like a nice guy

congratulations ! how much did you win ?
"this happened to me ! do not feel bad , it happens to people such as us !"

"that is a lot of people ! ! you are loved and appreciated ! now , its time to start planning his suprise birthday"
"oh no , i am so sorry to hear that . that is awful and makes me sad . have you talked to anyone about it ?"
"that is what you need to focus on is just giving her all of your love , she will cherish it . i am so sorry you are going through this , i hope that you can find peace with the situation ."
"wow , that is so cool of you . you really trust her"
are you ok ? that is absolutely devastating . i hope you have people to confide in right now .
"i am sorry to hear that . while diet is most of it , exercise can play a role too . how active is your lifestyle ?"
can not you place a call to them ?
that is amazing ! congratulations . what was the policy that changed ?
i am sorry that is rough . did you ever find out why ?

"how close did you lose by ? i bet at the next competition , you will wipe the floor with them ."
"oh my goodness that is so sad , i am sorry to hear about your father . are you handling him being gone okay ?"
"i understand completely . i hope that you can enjoy going to more games , and carry on his spirit when you go ."
oh no ! that is really embarrassing . hopefully she can move on from it and you can laugh about it one day .
i think it is so weird that cats do that . it is like they are bringing us trophies or something !
that is so sweet . it is good to have that kind of faith in your relationships .
have you called any rescue center yet ?
"oh wow , good for you . that education will help you the rest of your life !"
"oh man , i would have been really frustrated . does she know he is dating you now ?"
i totally understand the anxiety . you never know if they are baiting you or actually giving you a good deal . did you get a new car ?
"i am so sorry to hear about that , it must be awful . do you have friends and family that you can talk to about this ?"
"aw , he sounded like such a great friend !"
"that is so sweet . i really commend people who treat kids like their own , it is so important for a kid to grow up feeling like they have a lot of people in their corner . i have a stepdaughter myself ."
oh no now that is a sticky situation ! how d you manage ?
"oh man , i am sorry ! i have been there , it sucks ! are you okay though ?"

"that is a shame , i am sorry . does she have anything to keep her occupied while you work ?"
"i am sorry to hear about your dog passing away . but , i am happy you have a new friend in the new one ."
i hear you ! is she going out with her girlfriends ?
"ahh , sounds like a tough situation . maybe you should try letting your girlfriend know how you feel ."
how mortifying ! did anyone hear it ? did it smell ?
happy riding to your daughter
"that is awesome , i hope he returns the favor as well ."
"oh yeah , i have been there , i really understand"
that sounds wonderful ! do you get to use them yet ?
oh no ! kids do that sometimes . what happened ?
it is hard when they grow up . hopefully she will learn from her mistakes .
oh no ! i would be angry too !
oh that sounds good ! i am sure you studied lots ?
hey that is not too bad how long are you going for ?
"wow , how did that almost happen ? i would rethink my options ."
did they do a good job of cleaning your house ?
"that would make me nervous , you never know if they are looking through your things ."
that helps a lot with the peace of mind . i am glad it worked out well for you !
that is a shame . do you know who stole it ?
"oh no . that happened to my sister last year . we were able to work out a plan , but she had to get a loan temporarily ."
"ok , how much raise did you get ?"
too bad you ve been let down so often . i am glad your new worker is satisfactory .
do you still live nearby ?
did you like it ? what did you buy ?
"i am so sorry , you must feel terrible . it is their loss in the long run ."
oh man that is not good at all ! did he break anything ?
it is awesome to have a partner like that . that is certainly why they call it the other half .
i second that . finding that eternal partner is one of the greatest joys a human being can experience .
how did it turn out ?
oh no ! how awful ! did your thanksgiving improve ?
cool ! where did you move too ?
"oh , that does not seem like such hard work . it is fun to move into new houses . i like moving around ."
"i understand , life can do that to you , and looking back always bring fond memories"
oh ! did you find any good deals ?

"oh , sorry to hear that . there is something going around these days . i hope they are better now ."
i know me too ! why are you ready ?
you are prepared more than ever !
"i have not , i feel like it should be done by a professional ."
oh no ! probably tons of years of dirt caked into the rug . did you use the right cleaner ?
maybe the dirt adds to the whole antique feel of them .
that must ve been fun ! what did you guys do ?
that sounds like a really lovely way to go somewhere in a car !
what game do you play ?
"wow , is it the first time you are gon na see him ? is he going to stay at your place ?"
"thats awesome , never settle for less . always strive for more !"
that is the best way to do it . read before you buy .
"yes , my internet provider is notorious for that"
that must have been a good thing did y all celebrate .
"yeah , my cousin actually borrowed my car to take his driving test"
i do not blame you ! he should have been more responsible .
"omg , what happened ?"
pesky snakes . was it a black racer ? i see those all the time in my yard .
that is awesome ! is something holding you back ?
buying a home can be nerve wracking but in the end it is worth it !
"sometimes i am worried that i am that family member , but i am not sure what to do to make them have confidence in me ."
i am sorry that happened . i have dogs myself .
i enjoy reading .
"oh , yes i remember those days too so clearly . such carefree day , right ?"
what did you see ?
me too . about friends an d family . things i got to see and do .
oh no ! how did that end ?
oh that is so selfish . did you try and get back at her ?
is it because you trust their judgement or is there a different reason ?
that is always a good thing .
oh no ! i hate that ! so what did you do about it ?
poor dog ! did you find out why ? is it better now ?
oh ! what was it about ?
oh no ! i hate spiders ! were you able to avoid them and move your pots ?
i have a friend like that . we lose touch but we will always be great friends .
do you guys live far away from each other ? i love talking with my mom about her and my childhood .
oh no . did he stand you up ?
that stinks ! were you able to get the stain out ?
that sounds like good news and bad . i hope you will be going with him someday .
"rain is relaxing to myself , odd"
that is a wonderful situation to be in . are you planning to tell her ?
oh really what movie ?
"i love road trips , sounds like a good time ."
that sounds relaxing ! what did you watch
maybe i ll do that tonight !
oh no ! i am so sorry . what kind of dog was he ?
aww . mine is getting pretty old . i am not looking forward to losing him .
"oh boy , i guess you will have your hands full ."
thats good . abusive relationships are the worst .
yuck . did you throw the remote out ?
did you get all of it done ?
"mistakes are made , but still . i can how that would be annoying ."
"wow , that must have been pretty challenging . where you able to do it ?"
that sounds awesome ! did everything go well ?
did you adopt an animal
i feel all for those poor animals and want to adopt all of them
"i am sorry to hear that , i know she will be better"
"i bet it was , i am glad you are doing better now . did they find the person driving the van ? did they even stop ?"
"wow , thats awesome you were only in for a few days . i guess i have n t had an accident that bad before but i would have thought it would have been a longer time period ."
oh no ! ! haha . the first days of school can be so hectic ! but soon the routine will set in again and all will be good .
i would of did the same .
it was a very devastating storm .
how exciting ! you must be so proud of him . what an accomplishment !

"oh wow that is cool , i do not think ill ever purchase a new car . a good used one will be my best option !"
i watched that happen . been thinking about doing some research on trading with bitcoin .
yikes ! i would have jumped too .
that sounds awesome . it is important for kids to know self defense and also to be active so all boxes are checked .
that sounds great you must be jazzed up about it
"oh , that is terrible ! did you try to save the cat ?"
i have never heard of a hot water beach . what is it caused by ?
who are we talking about ? i am sorry you are upset . maybe you could talk to her and let her know you need help .
i bet it was ! did you end up finding it or did you have to cancel all of your cards ?
"i must have been terrifying , i am glad you both made it through it"
that is awful ! i can deal with dogs barking during the day but at night is no good .
that must ve been nice . i bet that reminded you a lot of when you were a kid . did you enjoy your time with your mom ?
that is really rough . do you think he may have relapsed ?
thats awsome hopefully he sticks with it . its a chick magbnet
"haha , yeah cats can be rude ! i prefer dogs myself . they are much sweeter ."

"aw , you must be lonely . at least you have her pet with you , right ? what pet does she have ?"
"oh man , that is terrifying . i am glad you did not get hit . what kind of crazy person tries to turn and change lanes at the same time ?"
yes it is definitely difficult to change doctors .
"yeah , did something in particular make you feel that way ?"
"aww , i am sorry . that is a tough one to go through . mine had the same ."
you will regret not going i think you should go
"wow , thats cool . what did you do ?"

oh yes ! i really hate that . it has happened to me more than i like . did you get a refund at least ?
"oh no , that is so sad . i am sure it would of meant a lot for you to be there ."
congratulations ! that is always a great feeling ! a reward after such hard work .
"it can not hurt to try , might as well give it a shot , right ?"
do you run into this issue a lot ? i could imagine grocery shopping to be a nightmare
"i do ! it grosses me out , even when it is my own ."
oh no ! so i guess you had to stay that way til you got to go home ?
that is just disgusting !
"it happens to everyone , being tired makes people so irritable . being a mom is tough as it is ."
i bet you ve had to do a lot of prep work . do you feel ready ?
that is very inspiring . how has it changed your life ?
what made you want to be a nurse ?
oh wow . did you not want to go ?
did you have to get it pulled ?
"that is awesome , i have n t been to a concert in ages . who is the band ?"
how do you feel about that ?
those must have brought back some great memories .
i have heard the same thing from my friends who have kids ! they say it is like a force takes over as soon as the baby is born
do you think they are up to something ?
"that is nice , pretty rare to have good neighbors these days it seems !"
uh oh . is he better now ?
"ok , good . what do you think caused the infection in the first place ?"
"aw , that is so sweet ! do you see a future together ?"
"that had to be rough , and glad to hear you are better . do you have any follow up appointments to go to ?"
"hey , good for you ! that takes dedication . i admire that ."
that is really exciting for her ! but i am sure being apart will be difficult for both of you .
"man , that really stinks . did insurance pay to repair your floor and cupboards ?"
i am so sorry to hear that . death is not an easy thing to cope with .
how exciting ! first time there ?
"sailor moon ! that was the best show ! i have shared it with my kids , too . and the laugh at the picture of me dressed up as sailor jupiter from loooooong ago !"

"oh , man . did you end up falling ?"
i am sorry to hear that she passed away . had she been sick a long time ?

"then keep your head up keep reaching for the stars ! maybe this will be the one ! ! but even if it does not turn out , keep on searching . your perfect job is waiting for you ."
"mine went back to school today ! i watched the bus drive off and i kinda looked around and said to myself , well shoot , what now ?"
"mine are older and think they are too cool for everything . i took my usual first day of school picture and i got , mom , are not we too old for this ?"
"when they are little , that is the best age for pictures they ll never meet a camera that they do not like ."
that is so fun ! i have always wanted to get into baking . how did the cake turn out ?
i am sorry . i bet you miss her a lot ?
wow ! where did you find those ? i remember watching that series as a kid !

you are lucky to have her ! it is hard to find someone to trust .
"aw , i am sure you tell her . i hope to be that kind of mom when my kids are adults ."
"aww , i am sure that is been nothing but positive for you ."

uh oh that is not good ! did they understand ?
"nice ! was he surprised , or hoping to do better"

did you finally manage to find a house you like ?
"oh yeah , school year starts soon . well i hope you will have an easy year !"
"that happens , you have to acknowledge mistakes to learn from them ."
"i hear that . i can not afford all of them , but i have several . nintendo forever !"
oh no . you must feel apprehensive . you forgive yourself ?
that is really nice . did it make you recall any memories you had forgotten about ?
that is so stressful .
"sometimes it can be hard to be patient , i can totally relate to that . not sleeping well can make you really irritable sometimes ."
are you excited to get back to work ?
that must be very challenging to deal with at times .
you must be excited ! are you a huge fan ?
well that must have been nice ! i assume you wanted it and not something different ?
"i hate when coworkers fight , it is so uncomfortable and you do not want to take sides"
i love to look at photos

oh no ! how terrible . i hope no one was hurt .
"no , im years old . dont plan on having kids for another couple years !"
oh my goodnes that must have been a lot of fun ! how long did it take ?

what happened ?
oops . what did you bet about ?
im sorry to hear that . did you hurt yourself ?
"you know , i love cats but do you think it needs a mental evaluation or was it upset you were gone so long ?"
i dont think i would do that . seems a little odd to me
congratulations i know you must be very proud
no is it fun ?

"that is very odd , i would n t give them any of that information . he is up to no good !"
"man , i love when you can enjoy some good food from your childhood . it brings back so many memories ."
that is frustrating ! most people do not know basic trouble shooting skills .

i am such a scaredy cat when it comes to scary movies . what was the movie about ?
"wow . that is amazing , i love to change . what color did you choose ?"

"i understand . my little brother did too . . i have the family and he has the career . we are years apart , but he make a ton more money than , i do . maybe you can get your brother to invest in homes , and you all start a business ."
"right , you should ! remember they arent making any more land !"
"i will go out on a limb and say she did not hold up her end , hope you get your garden back bright and beautiful"

"oooh , thats so scary and bad of them"
"my friend and i were out at the bars one night , doing the usual young people thing . they had been acting off a little all night , and when i asked if they were okay , they told me everything was fine . i knew this was not true since i had known this person for years , but the night came to a close and we got a cab home ."
your friend must trust and care for you a lot to confide in you like that . how did you react ?
wow ! i hope he does not do anything too crazy !
oh that is great . were you able to help him move ?
"sometimes going out with friends can relax the mind , who knows you might ace the test ."
"hello , why whats happened ?"
you founded the preacher helpful ?
what was the secret about ?
i am really sorry to hear that . how are you healing from it ?
i mean did they reward your years of service at your job by giving you a present or throwing you a party . it is pretty common for workers when they reach such a milestone to be recognized in such a way .
"thats great , are you enjoying it ?"
oh i am so socially awkward and anxious i would never be able to give a speech . how did it turn out ?
oh i am so sorry to hear that . i hope that she will be alright . is it serious ?
"that is very lucky , how much was it for ?"
that is good to be able to depend on others .
it is nice to be loyal to people who are loyal to you . is your job going to offer you any benefits for your loyalty ?
food is the hardest part when it comes to getting healthy sometimes . dont give up !
"oh my that must have been frightening ! poor little cat , what happened afterwards ?"
that sould make me feel sad . did you talk to him about it ?
i certainly know that feeling .
do you plan on paying him back quickly ?
uh oh . i am sorry to hear that . that is never a good thing to do as a supervisor .
something juicy i hope .
oh no ! i am afraid to ask what it was . . . . but what was it ?
oh dear . is it what i am thinking ? did she wreck it ?
i am so sorry to hear about that . the good thing is she is okay
"wow , that is really great that they pitched in to help . you must be happy about that !"
making moves to do better is all you can do . how has it been going ?
that is great ! the longer you do it the easier it will get . keep up the good work !
what were you invited to speak about ?
"i hate to ask what happen , i imagine something went wrong"
had she been bothering you recently ?
what a pain ! i think when a big company makes so much money and they say they
that is awesome . it is wonderful to feel prepared !
congradulations . you must be excited and proud . are you enjoying the new car ?
oh no ! hopefully you have full coverage ?
"yeah but , its better than having no car !"
that is great ! when is the wedding ?
are you having a bachelor party ?
the best kind of bachelor party . that is exactly what i did for mine . . . years ago .
how much did she give you over
"that sounds like he startled you quite a bit , hope it was not a black cat ."
i am sorry to hear that . how did that make you feel ?
i have not seen the message about the incident but i do hope that person will speak to you .
that was the right thing to do . you respect your marriage .
i am sorry you had to go through all that stress . but yay for you being able to leave that situation !
do you trust your friend ?
would it be a promotion ?
that is a pretty weird thing to have happen
sounds like somebody needs an accountabili buddy . . .
that is not ok to do .
he must have been very excited ! that is awesome .
oh no ! did they take you to jail ?
"oh my , it must have been an exciting time for you seeing your brother after such a long time"
sounds scary . did you find out what it was ?
you should go to their place
oh no ! they are mean to not have told you . i would ve told you . how did it even get there ?
"hey , i bet you will do great ! nothing to stress about ."
"wow , you must really be excited . do you have room for it in your kitchen ?"
congratulations on the good raising of the kid ! i bet you were just flooded with all kinds of memories .
wow that is so sweet . have you shown her it yet ?
hail can be freaky ! was there any damage ?
i bet that was nice though .
"wow , what happened next , is he alright ?"
wow what type of dog is he ? is he a big one that acts tough or a little one that needs lots of love ?
"wow , i actually love them ! did you take him to see a vet ? you seem so concerned about him to even take time off work ."
nice ! what did you end up with ?
i say if you can afford it enjoy it . what is your favorite feature ?
"i have n t , but i would love to get one . i love full feature phones !"
you must be very fond of such memories . do they make you feel nostalgic ?
"wow , he did he do ?"
what am amazing feeling that must be ! did it take you a long time ? must have felt so satisfying .
i agree ! is she excited ?
feeling sentimental much ?
sorry to hear that . i hope you are not feeling too sad .
maybe its time to find a new job ?
awesome . are you feeling a little jealous ?
"do not worry , i am sure she ll put a dent in it before the month is up ."
oh my goodness . thats so cool . who did you show it to .
"wow , love looking through memorable s . brings back good memories ."
"yeah , tell me about it . i have nothing from that far back from my family ."
"yeah , i know what you mean . coffee always cures my headache . but then again it is probably not having coffee that causes the headache too ."
why not ? is everything okay ?
oh that is awful . the loss of a pet is just the worst
"it is good to have people you can count on . if you can not trust your family , who can you trust ?"
that is unfortunate . i hope you did not get chewed out too badly .
"sorry to hear that , it must be absolutely devastating . but you must stay strong ."
what ? oh no ! can they do that ? i would fight it and see what happened . you must feel sick .
oh no ! i take they still got their claws . mine is the same way but there is one piece of furniture he just insists on ruining .
oh my goodness . they got a taste of it and went to town . i am so sorry .
yeah i have gone a few times actually . do you like them ?
"that is awesome ! i wish you all the luck , but i bet you will not even need it ."
oops ! do you think that you can replace it ?
that was nice of you to do . what kind of dog does she have ?
"oh my , do you have a draft saved . or was that the only copy ?"
that is amazing ! did you get i ?
"that is really great . you are setting a good example for your kids , too ."
that is a good place to be . are you happy with your job ?
yep more than that and you will need a big house and lots of toys !
really ? that must be fun
ugh do you have any security camera that might have captured what happened ?
i hope you do very well ! what subject ?
haha ! that definitely must have scared many people that did not know what it was . that must be hilarious to watch !
"and you know when men get sick , they are on their death bed ."
i am sorry about that . what happened ?
i am sorry to hear that .
it must be very difficult for you . do you have someone you can talk to about it ? i find that remembering the good times helps you keep their memory alive .
awesome ! what are your plans for this weekend .
that is wonderful . i will be spending time at home .
that is awesome ! what show ?
has she had a history of illness ?
i have some of that too . it would make me a little nervous .
really ? why you should have been patient .
wow ! that is really cool ! what will you buy ?
"that must have been embarrassing , wasnt it ?"
was it a prestigious or expensive vase ?
"great , since you are prepared i am sure you will do great !"
it is very scary ! i live near the coast too ! i do not know if my home will still be here in years .
i am so glad to hear everything is going well for you ! . it is good to hear your health is improving .
oh no ! i am so sorry ! is she okay ? that is so great that she has you .
that is good that you trusted him . sometimes i miss out on good opportunities because it is hard to trust .
your intuition seems to be trustful and the right way to go
haha . . . you little thief ! joking that must have been some good pizza !
haha ! no ! it is not wrong ! my son played travel baseball for years and we spent days a week at the ballfields !
wow ! how did it go ?
that would really stress me out
oh they need to take care of that asap !
that awful ! were you able to continue without it ? that must have really messed up your rhythm .
you are a good friend .
why did he move so far away ?
"i hope your mom can understand , it was an accident and everyone makes mistakes"
was it a good feeling or a bad feeling ?
i do too . being a kid was so easy .
also not having a ton of responsibilites !
"oh man , that is a long break . how did it go ?"
that is great ! did your co workers help ?
"hahaha that is funny . my bad , i feel like i need to hit the gym again as well ."
what did you get up to in august usually ?
i used to love bonfires back in my day those were the days .
"whoa that is out of left field , how d that happen ."
good for you ! are you going to tell your girlfriend about it ?
"aww , so cute ! i bet your having such a fun time with him her !"
oh no ! how gross ! that must have been so embarrassing ! were you able to clean yourself up ?
it is great that you only have one more year left ! what are you getting a degree in ?
"i think it is just human nature . even if it were wrong , there may be nothing you can do about it . but i think there are ways you can take your negative emotions and put a positive spin on them , in order to motivate you in a more healthy , conducive way ."
"ok , and do you want to share this problem ?"
did you want a watch ?
it is your right as an american citizen .
is it your first ferrari ?
what did he say in response ?
"i can just imagine , it must have been exciting for you ."
i am so sorry to hear that . is there a reason why you could not ?
oh no that is terrible ! i hope you and your family evacuated safely .
oh no ! were you able to find him her ?
"oh wow , that is cool . and surprising haha"
i love sushi its delicious
i am sure she is a lovely woman .
that is exciting news ! you must be so happy for her ! are you going out to celebrate ?
i hope you have a good time !
hm sounds like a healthy choice ! do you feel good about yourself now ?
"good . money , while important , is certainly not everything ."
wow ! how did that work out for you ?
i am sure you will ace it ! what kind of car are you taking the exam in .
"nice , what will you be cooking ?"
"five is a great number , but six is even better . it is my favorite number , do not know why either !"
i am glad to hear she is doing well .
"oh no ! what a bother , were you able to clean it up ?"
"oh , that would be tough ! were they together for a long time ?"
what happened ? how come you didnt get it ?
i think you will need to tell him how you feel about this . otherwise you may end up taking more care of the cat than him .
"i am not sure what that means , but that sounds exciting , especially if you are excited about it . congratulations ! hopefully that means you guys will just keep getting bigger and bigger ."
do you enjoy your alone time or do you wish you had people around ?
"hey that is awesome man i am proud of you , was it hard ?"
how far along do you think you are ?
"that must have hurt , did you get injured ?"
i do not blame you . i would be trying to avoid bills too .
im excited for you ! where are you goin ?
what city are they moving to ?
"glad to hear that , i hope you continue to be faithful to her in the future ."
did you buy it all by yourself ?
did you fall a lot ?
i love haunted houses ! did you go alone ?
ugh you need to tell him to return those things and tidy up the house .
was a neighborhood you frequented ?
how did that make you feel ?
i am sorry to hear of your grandmother s passing . my condolences to you and your family .
"oh , i am so sorry . was it unexpected ?"
oh no ! those little ones seem to do stuff like that all the time .
oh cool . i love looking through my old photos . makes me feel warm and fuzzy .
"oh no , did it burn ?"
"that must of been fun , where did you meet ?"
"oh no , that is terrible . is there anyway to redo it ?"
"that sounds amazing , i hope they enjoy it a lot !"
that is wonderful ! are you thinking of proposing ?
wowza ! that is a good spouse . were you suprised ?
that is not good . did they give you back your money ?
"i would be upset too , they need to do their work properly ."
i am glad that you got it cleared up .
why ? are you not happy with the job or you want to make more money ?
i have had that happen before and it is super annoying !
"i used to get chased by dogs too , back then when i was younger fences were not to common"
that sounds fun ! the arcades were always kind of noisy for me though .
"oh , that is so hard ! how are you feeling about it ? itching to go back , or dreading it ?"
ouch ! what did they do for it ?
that can be nerve wracking . are you worried ?
ah . i find a mock interview with a friend can help .
that is smart of you . how did it go ?
"that is so sad to hear , it must be tough for you"
good job ! hopefully she deserves the faithful person you are !
its possible she is just trying to be helpful .
did he live up to the belief ?
how exciting for you . kids truly are amazing . now the fun really starts .
that is great ! congrats !
"aw , will you be able to keep her company ?"
"aw , nice ! that is kind of cool , actually . i hope you really encourage her to stick to it and do well . sometimes there can be a lot of expectations that come with that stuff , so whatever you can do to not add pressure to it would be great ."
"i not sure what do you mean , but can use my imagination , it sounds like something really embarrassing ."
"dang , i can relate i moved away from my mom a long time ago and still get a little homesick ."
"i feel like this is me . i am clean , but i am stuck with a dirty roommate who does not do dishes . and i also live in a place that is old and looks terrible to begin with . sorry you have to deal with that , because i know i hate living in it !"
oh no ! that can be very scary ! did you make it out ok ?
was it a stranger or someone you knew ?
"oh really , what was the play ?"
that is horrible . i would talk to your best friend and tell him how you feel firstly .
whoop whoop ! thanks for reminding me . i have to purchase youtube live for it .
same here ! who is your team ?
that must have been so fun !
i guarantee that you will be fine ! i graduated with a master s last year
that is wonderful news . i have also battled depression and am feeling better now . that is a real big deal .
thats nice to hear . its the best feeling when kids come back home to visit .
do you miss him ?
"oh no , that is terrible . is he in legal trouble ?"
how come ?
"oh , that is horrible . i am sorry that happened to you !"
"why is that , might i ask ? maybe i can help you reframe it better to look at it more positively ."
"that is very lucky of you , what do you plan on doing now ?"
do not be nervous . i am sure you did alright . it is normal to think that but most of the time it is all in the head .
i hope you feel better soon . maybe you can take a trip out to visit her ?
i bet she really misses you . how far away did you move ?
yea that can be tough . what kind of dogs ? are they easy to train ?
yup . i did that with my new cat and it ended up working out ok .
"i can understand the anxiety , i am sure you will do fine though !"
is it possible to re arrange the date to when the weather would be more favorable ?
oh nice ! ! what kind of treats are you using ?
"that is awful , how did your cat die ?"
that is good ! do you usually like math ?
"i am sorry to hear that , it is pretty embarassing to be in situations like that"
"it is good to hear someone doing well for once . most people are usually only up for complaining and seeing the negatives in things . i do not want to be too nosey , but can you tell me why you are feeling good about things lately ?"
wow i bet you were terrified ! did you see again after or just that once .
sorry to hear that . what is he barking at ?
haha that is not a problem ! you must be a good cook !
that is a shame ! i am sorry to hear that . if you really like you job then just keep working hard . i am sure they will recognize your efforts pretty soon .
that is great . are you a nurse ?
"is there any chance for something to happen ? seems like you developed a connection from afar , if he s still on your mind . why do you think there is no chance ?"
i am sorry . it can be hard to be in a situation where you think the other person is cheating . is there any other reason she might be acting suspicious ? have you talked to her about it ?
"oh yeah , that is pretty embarrassing ! but just imagine if you watched that happen to someone else . you would probably be laughing too . lol"
"i agree ! i am in a long distance relationship , but we have developed so much trust over the years we have been together that i never worry about what she s doing or who she s with , and neither does she worry about me . we have slowly built up our communication over the years . i am glad to hear that you have the same thing in yours ."
try not to stress out about it all weekend . if you did not do anything wrong nothing bad will happen .
"brothers always seem to want to get into fights with one another , but at the end of the day , i am sure you guys love each other very much !"
what made you give them all away ?
they are looking pretty good this year .
thats great ! how come ?
that is unfortunate . at least you can use the experience with your current internship to get you to another place you want to go !
thats awesome ! where has he been ?
nice ! and what country might that be ?
that is cool ! that is a long time ! was he the same as he used to be ?
"that is a lofty goal , but if you work hard maybe you can achieve it ."

"i am the same way with my wife , i trust her ."

that sounds amazing ! mom s food is always the best .
"oh no , what did you do ?"
haha . has she found out yet ? i bet she was mad
that sounds like a nightmare ! hopefully no one was hurt .

i completely agree . it used to be about the story line and the character development .
"ah , could not resist ? just make up and eat well tomorrow !"

"that sounds cool , they are a great vehicle"
"oh im so sorry ! it hurts when our parents leave us . my uncle , who was basically my father , died in april ."
that is awful . are you going to complain to the restaurant ?

"yum ! i had pizza as well tonight , although i did not make it ."
"ugh , do you know how it got there ?"
"i am sure you will do fine ! just be confident , what is the job"
haha i am sorry to laugh . is it an expensive window to fix .
sorry to hear that . have you tried encouraging them to play together ?
"oh i am so sorry . it is ok , it probably was not the cheetos that got him rodents just do not have a long lifespan . i hope you feel better ."
do you think you can impress them ?
"it definitely can be , just learn to drive defensively !"
are you prepared ? do you have all the ingredients ?
did it bring back good memories ?
i can understand your frustration .

your mom must be a strong woman .
what a bummer . did you have any sort of coverage for it ? and how did you do it accidentally ?
yeah well you only have so much time to work with . time management is one of the most important skills you can learn .
"maybe you unconsciously wanted to wear it . maybe you have some hidden desires your subconscious wanted to explore for you ? what if you went and did it again the next day , to see if you liked it ?"
whoop whoop ! that is awesome ! i hope you get the job .
what show is it ?
"yeah , it is weird going back to college ."
"okay , so i never understood why people ate it . what is it about it that makes them want to do that ? i just flicked mine . and i thought it stopped at a child s age . really interesting ."
that must have been unbearable . did you complain to the staff about the smell ?
that is a terrible feeling . i saw a movie where a family actually left their kid at home . that would be the worst .
avatar the airbender or james cameroons avatar ?
they just didnt play like a team and its no surprise that happened .

"holy cow , congratualtions , that sure is smart of you !"

"i get that , i have had jobs like that , some people just thrive on drama , they do not enjoy anything more than that"
eh give him a dollar and tell him to enter the contest himself .
"i hate sayings , but the one that goes , tough times do not last , but tough people do , really applies . life is long . you have plenty of time to change your fortune , and you seem self aware enough to do it . i hope you can work your way back up ."

i am lucky to have someone like my fiancee too ! what makes you so grateful about your fiancee

"i can not wait either , i am looking forward to it as well . do you know when the release date is ?"
i agree . everyone seems to be out for themself and do not care to help other or take others into consideration
oh god ! how much did he rip you off by ?
"this happens a lot at work , maybe try to talk to them about it ?"
how do you feel about it ? ready ?

"that is a good idea , what do you need to buy ?"

what kind of restaurant was it ?
"go on ! tell me about it , let s hear it"
what ended up happening ?
"how long did you have your dog for ? that must ve been very painful , losing a pet is always hard"
with those kind of people you just have to be blunt . if that does not work then it is time to excuse yourself from the conversation .
were they good memories ?
"oh , im sorry to hear that ! i know how hard that can be to lose a loved pet ."
how exciting ! what is he planning on doing next ?
fun jobs with good pay do exist
"oh , it is crazy what some people will try . but , sometimes an argument can get very interesting to watch !"
"i understand ! i felt the same when my son left , it is seems so much less noise and talk ."
a good friend is hard to find .
do you have a best friend ?
how long have you been friends ?
yes . this situation happened every friends relation . due to this we are in relation with a family members
do not worry all the friends are came to you be happy
"yes , one friend"
that could def be an improvemnt . what kind did you have in mind
was it a suprise ?
i really do hate that stuff
i know you have really been looking forward to this . where did you decide on going ?
were you able to return it ?
did he go home with you ?
"oh , no ! well , it happens sometimes , we get so busy and do not notice ."
"that is fantastic ! it certainly is a great feeling , financial freedom !"
left until what ?
what was sketchy about it ?
what was it it ?
you cant be serious .
you definitely made my day .
are you currently saving up ?
i bet . how far south of the continent are you ?
cool . i have a friend that lives in brazil
that is a good thing . lying to the police opens a whole world of trouble .
how did you cut your hand ?
did you get hurt doing the robbery ?
are you going because someone else wants to or was it something that you wanted to do ?
oh no did people look at you judgingly ?
whow ! that is one mean car ! what did your friend say ?

"about to , what happened ?"
uhoh . i am assuming it was not safely returned to you ?
yes but that is how it goes sometimes .
that is great . are you working ?
you are wonderful just the way you are ! be happy that you are alive and healthy and beautiful ! i am sure your brother wishes he could have something of yours too .
i hope you had insurance .
oh i hope nothing bad came from that ?
"that is really hard to do . i should do the same thing , but i still start my day with a big glass of iced coffee every day . it could help though ."
good luck . what class ?
sometime you got to pay for quality .
i hope you did . is it one that you really wanted ?
i am sorry to hear that . i am sure you be fine .
"wow , what a thrilling sport . yeah , i sure hope he knows what he s doing . you life depends on it !"
why can not you play ? that must be very disappointing .
"haha , why did you go on ? peer pressure ?"
is that good or bad ?
i know . those were the days .
"that sucks , did the house get any damage ?"
"that is great , hope you get it ! but , seems you have much on your plate already ."
"oh , no . do you have a plan b ?"
that is no good ! why have you been feeling so sad and depressed ?
that must have been so cool to drive around in a ferrari . was it fun ?
oh no ! he does not seem like such a good friend then . i hate it when friends pull stuff like that !
that is terrible . did you call the police ?
that is so scary . did he destroy anything ?
most people do not possess those qualities these days . that is quite honorable of you . being faithful is quite important !
"i understand , my parents are and , both with dementia ."
nice ! sounds like you will be successful then ! i think you will do great !
that must be very difficult to have to wait for results . i hope they come back and everything is fine though .
that is so great ! you seem quite content .
that is interesting . why on earth would she want it back ?
i am in that boat right now too . i feel it is going to be a long time coming .
i dont have any kids . i want to adopt one day .
"yeah , it was fun . . . and so free ."
there is nothing better than being content .
oh yikes ! that is a scary thing to witness . it is good to be safe these days with so many people using phones while driving and even walking . it is dangerous out there and you never know what can happen to you at any moment .
that is not good ! have you considered going to rehab ?
what did you ? did you return to the store ?
did you have any money bet on it ?
not quite sure i get what youre saying . lost as in missing ?
"oh , it happens to the best of us . i have done the same a gazillion times ! it does not get any better or funnier , lol ."
was it a large one ?
that is great . is it a big one ?
"oh , wow , that is absolutely terrible ! i can imagine it was horrifying for you ."
uh oh ! that is not a good sign ! do you think they are going to call it quits ?
"that sounds like it is going to be a super trip , you will have a blast"
"yes , death is always a tough thing to deal with especially when they are close like parents . but that life and every single person on this planet will have to deal with that at some point in life . it is just the nature of life ."
"oh , how cute ! i love animals , especially puppies !"
"that is good . i know it is very expensive to replace that part , so i am sure you are relieved ."
"that would make me nervous ! you never know what kind of person it could be , a predator perhaps ."
that is always a great feeling ! i love gardening ! what did you plant ?
i am sorry to hear about all the layoffs . i will pray for you at church for you to keep your job . what do you do for work ?
the weather is terrible here also . i hate that . are you on the east side of america ?
oh that is a tough period . poor baby ! but with mammas love everything is alright . you are such a great mother !
"oh no ! that is terrible . what made you choose that stock , and what will you do now ?"
that is great ! did you win your fight .
"that is great ! i love soccer . i grew up in scotland , where everyone s golf and soccer crazy . how old is your son ?"
oh no ! ! i hope it was not coffee ! yes that is pretty embarrassing . people probably thought you peed your pants .
oh yeah . was the food good ? what about the service ?
i hate aggressive drivers . they cause the majority of the accidents .
that sounds like fun . what were you taking pictures of ? i did not know film existed anymore lol
"first im sorry for your heartbreak , but second . . . its okay to be alone to let the feelings pass . how long has it been ?"
that is great . what is it a big amount that you had to pay back ?
"awe , that is a very good friend to have . you are very lucky to have a friend like that . hopefully you are there for him too ."
that is great . it really feels great when we accomplish something and reach our goals .
that was nice of you . i hope she gave it back to you when you needed to use it yourself .
and did he pull through ?
did you all have a good time there ?
oh my . . . you have to be careful when you use the internet for school assignments .
weekends are beautiful if you do not work on them and have nothing to do !
"that sounds very scary , what happened ?"
how are you still friends ?
that is cool ! maybe he will be the magic johnson of the family . hey you never know !
it is great looking through old photo albums and remembering all those great times .
hey it happens to the best of us . were you able to clean it up well ?
that is great to hear . was it a boy or a girl ?
oh really ? ! what did they find ?
i hate spiders . there is nothing worse than waking up and seeing one above you on the ceiling as you are laying in bed .
and how did you feel about taking another person s forgotten belongings ?
sounds like it going to be an interesting trip
congratulations ! i fail to see the relevance between having a good grade and shopping however . are you being rewarded for your grades ?
"was he using it or something ? why did you think it was him , and how did you find out it was you ?"
you have a secret spot for your headphones . are they super expensive ?
i have zero kids . i break stuff all the time .
i have never been there . i think it would be intimidating .
my dad and uncle actually went camping down there . you go with a guide and you set up camp in a few different places .
"im the same , but i think in a place like the grand canyon , it is really dangerous to try to go down there alone ."
good luck . i hope you do really well during the interview .
oh no that is terrible ! did you end up finding her purse ?
oh dear . i am so sorry that happened to you . were you hurt ?
that is so annoying . did you need it for a special occasion ?
sorry to hear that . i lost both my grandparents in the same year .
i know what you mean . me too ! what was your favorite part about the s ?
how come ? is your sister a minor and are you an adult ?
"that does not sound fair at all , i wonder why she did that ."
"if i were you , i would ask your mom why she paid for your sisters items and not yours . that is so mean ."
that could be creepy depending on the person . i am extra paranoid though .
that is great ! consistency is key !
"kids like touching and looking at things , i am sure no real harm was done . people like making a big deal out of everything ."
i am happy for you . how did it feel
"i am usually that way , whenever i have a doctor s appointment . i hope everything went well ."
"oh , that is a shame cooking s such fun . why did you stop cooking ?"
"gosh , i could not afford to do that ! it is far cheaper for me to cook up a big pot of stew or something and freeze it for busy days ."
"that stuff s hard to come by ! it is so easy to chuck stuff in a pot and then go watch tv or do something else for a couple of hours . tastes better , too !"
it
it is weird the way some things from our past seem so timeless . it is nice you had a good experience seeing your school .
would you be able to go meet him instead ?
did you get any news back ?
"sorry to here that , it must be tough for you at this moment"
oh my dad loves football too . i bet you have some great memories .
do you have a patio or backyard to do that in ?
you must have been really prepared to be so certain of achieving a perfect score !
that is really neat do you have a kid ?
wow ! is that old for an iguana ? im sorry to hear that
my daughter wants an iguana . i am scared of animals
that can be frustrating . did you do anything to help ?
"was the cake that good , or were you trying to make him angry ?"
i guess he really need it . did you give him the money ?
did she end up being able to go ?
i dislike people who do that . i never understood why ! have you tried talking to him ?
"i do that sometimes to you , memories are always nice"
is it your birthday ?
what kind of event is it ?
that happened to me once . it was terrifying . were you okay ?
how did you end up doing ?
what did he get you instead ?
that is not cool at all . why would he say that ? maybe he misplaced it .
"i love good books , what was it about ?"
i love sitting on the porch when the weather is nice .
i imagine that would be a bit unnerving . it being dark and anything being possible .
did she accept ? i am sure you would be great to go out with .
my parents are no longer living
"really , me going to get relax by having beer"
"that is good , is he struggling now ?"

where did you go ?
oh awesome ! what are the tickets for ?
oh that sounds dramatic . how did it turn out ?
"a new job can be a little nerve wracking . did it get better , once you settled in ?"
i wish i was that lucky ! i always lose .
that sucks . did you have a hard time with it ?
you could always start saving now
that is great ! are you really excited ?

that is great ! did you win it on a table game or at a machine ?
did you stop playing after that or did you try to win more ?

that is a good thing . a lot of people like me ! hate hated it . she ll do so much better if she s happy .
how old is she ? is she studying something she can use later in life ?
"oh , well goodness , encourage her ! the sooner she starts learning to love to learn the more joy she ll get out of it !"
"that is a good idea . it is best to be prepared for a dangerous weather situation , as you never know when it can happen ."
"i feel sure as well , you are clearly determined and intentional ."

just leave the house and have someone trash it for you .
oh no . i am so sorry to hear that . were you close with this coworker ?
than i completely understand that would be so hard
that would even make it worse . did it happen all of a sudden ?
"nice , it is like little kids can learn anything !"
oh gosh ! are you ok ?
ouch what a jerk . why did he do that ?
oh no ! was you at least at home when that happened ?
"im so sorry , i can not immagine that"
"i can agree with that , adulting sucks"
what do you mean ?
"i truly do feel bad that you have to endure that . my girlfriend and i were just talking about how horrible she s going to feel when she loses her havanese pup at some point in the distant future , since she s so close to her . i hope you can grieve the loss of your great friend in a healthy way ."
"that is wonderful ! you are right , it is so rewarding to stand back and see everything clean once you are done ."
"was your landlord truly trying their best , or did they simply not care about your well being at that time ?"
ugh . people like that are gross .
wow i envy you . that sounds like a wonderful feeling !
i did not think that was possible for a dog on a walk ! what kind of dog do you have ?
"funny you say that . . . my roommate just got a cat about a month ago . i was hesitant to agree to share the apartment with it , as i am not the most fond of them . but i did not want to say no . it is actually been an affectionate cat so far ."
what kind of hobby do you have ?
that sounds like an ugly scene . . . did anybody step in
that is awesome ! i am happy for you !
what kind of trouble is he having right now ?
good job . that can be really tough to go through that .
"they ll understand , sometimes it is better not to overextend yourself"
"yes , i love it here . it is the greatest country in the world ."
"dear lord , how old are you ?"
o no did you report it to the hospital
you want to start school back up ? what are you going for ?
oh yes ! i know your feeling . i see my dog as a child as well .
"that is touching , how is it these days ?"

that would be great . good luck .
congratulations ! i am so happy to hear that . you must be really excited !
"that isnt good , were they true ?"

how did he get hurt ?
that happened to me a few weeks ago . i was severely dehydrated and i fainted . i hit the ground hard .
oh dang . do you think it was intentional ?
"oh no , what did you buy ?"
sorry to hear that . do you think it was an intruder or just some prankster ?
"what stops you from going ? being busy with life , or just deep down you just do not want to go"
life is good when its like that
"i do not blame you , i would have eaten some . did they notice ?"
what type of candy was it ? i like sour patch and chocolates .
where are you going ?
school can be al ot of work
i am sure she ll be flattered if you are honest about how you are feeling !
what do you mean i think it is pretty good right now
"that is terrible , i hope everything is ok"
that is got to be annoying ! have you tried telling him to stop ?
what was it ?
"same here . are you living on a street where it is normal , as far as crime ?"
"yeah , when i was younger i did some of that stuff as well . it is a really embarrassing thing to hear stories about things you did that you do not remember doing ."
oooh like what kind of toys ?
you ever think about moving ?
"aww , how long have you been together ?"
why did you steal stuff ?
nice ! i wish i was more active in searching for scholarships like it sounds like you are . but this one sounds like it was a lot of hard work to earn . i have n t been the smartest about lightening the student loan debt burden while in school . good on you for looking ahead .
nothing like a deep clean to breathe new life into your home ! its a great idea to get it out of the way now so it will not me on your mind once things start to get busy .
someone broke in ?
"i agree , such helicopter parents exercise far too much control on their kids , doing more harm than good in the long run ."
what kind of belt does he have ?
oh man i am jealous . are you going with anyone ?
did you tell him he ate it in his sleep
why are you having to go again ?
oh no . well i hope that makes him better
i am happy for you . just keep going
"that is great . i do not have any tattoos myself , but a lot of people i know do . and it seems expensive . so i am glad he s not charging you much ."
"i hope so , too . heart conditions can be scary ! do you have anyone closer to her that could check in ?"
what is deserved or undeserved ?
that is good timing at least . glad it did not take too long .
she sounds like a great girl . i am sure it will you sound like a happy couple .
why would your uncle be upset ? and how do you feel about the situation ? it sounds like there is a lot to unpack there .
that is great when life just feels right
"you must be feeling nostalgic , maybe your kids will enjoy them"
"wow , that was super nice of him . you are lucky to have such a great dad ."
yeah but that is his ob
"that sounds like an uncomfortable situation . what ended up happening ? i kind of avoid large crowds and sports events because of this , since there is usually alcohol involved ."
"yikes , that is very disrespectful . i hope you told him how you feel about that ."
did your boyfriend notice ?
did he ! you lucky dog !
were you actually under the influence ?
"that sucks , i am sorry to hear it . did they at least ask you first ?"
"dang , i guess she was not your friend after all"
"oh no , did you get into trouble with your boss ?"
"i get that , nothing can beat home !"
a good dentist is great to have !
what were the left overs ?
sounds like quite the adventure you had . you must feel proud of yourself .
nice you must feel pretty lucky
are you happy with it
a couch ! how was it hurting you ?
"oh , no ! it happens to the best of us ."
that is good to hear ! what makes him so awesome ?
gross ! i would have been super mad if my cat did that ! what did you do ?
"oh no , maybe try going to reddit and ask people what to do in your city !"
uh oh ! how was it driving weird ?
oh yeah ? you applying to a new job ?
what does it not do right ?
"oh wow , that is not good . hopefully you had good insurance and that you are ok !"

sorry to hear that but why did you distance yourself from your friends ?
oh no ! are you ok ?
aww i am sorry . maybe enjoy a glass of wine and watch some girly shows . my husband is in the military and gone a lot so i feel for you .
"i think if it is done without care then yes , care for what she would feel that is . maybe you just have to tell the truth about what you are feeling , but it is up to you !"
that was very nice of him .
that is nice . was it a special occasion or anything ?
what kind of memories
"oh wow , i am sorry to hear that ! loss can be hard"
congrats ! that sounds like a good movie !
sorry to hear that . you must be going through a tough time .
"hey , congratulations . that must have been a lot of hard work . i wish i put more time into extracurricular stuff like that . it is a good look in the future . especially the debate team you develop so many good life skills with that !"
"glad to hear it ! health is such an important thing , and the more you look after your body , the better it will treat you ."
uh oh ! are you going to ask him to pay for it ? or at least fix it ?
that is strange . did you like the gift ?
"oh my , sorry to hear that . how is he holding up ?"
what are those ? your grades ?
did you find out why he was fleeing the draft ?
that is awesome ! i bet you are so proud
were you playing in a team ?
"i am glad you are taking it seriously , parents have the ability to be the best thing that ever happened to their kids lives , or the worst , but i am sure you are doing your best"
that is great ! what percentage are you thinking you will be getting ?
how d it end up after the fact ?
"that is always fun , to see those random memories crop up when you least expect . what kind of board games were they ?"
that is funny i feel like someone should have said something though
how long have you had it ?
wow that is lucky .
which six flags did you go to ?
"nice , such relics of the past really hit you with a wave of nostalgia . did the gear still fit you ?"
"oh nice , how did it go ?"
haha i bet it was not that bad . . . . was it
you must feel so content at this point . it must have taken a lot of hard work to get to this point !
"that is unfortunate , is it possible to go through chemotherapy again ?"
that is so sad . dogs become part of the family so when something like that happens it is like losing a family member
"yeah , i have a doughter as well and understand . i guess kids will be kids !"
"uh oh , do you think you were being rowdy ?"
"oh my , sounds like you have the dreaded roommate situation on your hands . have you tried talking to him ?"
that will be nice . are you going to have some free time ?
is the car terribly damaged ?
"that sucks , it takes so long for them to arrive !"
"i feel that , even though i prefer winter"
is that a game ?
you can train and get better
why is that ?
nice ! you must be so proud of him to achieve such a milestone !
oh god ! is everyone you care about ok ?
do you find value in them still ?
how did he get it ?
oh my god ! are you ok ? was anyone home ? did they take anything important ?
who is it ?
was the fire set by someone or an accident ?
that is good . it is nice to focus on the positives
ugh teenagers can be so troublesome some times ! i hope you made him realize what he did was wrong .
helping animals sometimes brings great pleasure . you did a good deed
that sounds like a cool place to go ! can you bring your cat there ?
nice ! you must be so proud ! how old is he ?
what did they do ?
that is wonderful ! i bet it was a nice trip down memory lane .
wow that is been a long time . did you two have a good time together ?
what did you do ?
what did your friends do ?
"oh no , when can you take it again ?"
hey that is great ! how long has it been ?
whats going to happen ?

nice ! did you have a good time ?
gratz . what is the secret ?
was he drinking heavy ? i am sorry hope the night was not too bad .
do not be ! you are awesome the way you are !
hey . . . congratulations to you on both fronts ! that sounds like double good news . it was probably fun having your hard work rewarded with seeing the faces of all your loved ones and having them personally congratulate you .
"ahh , is he a troublemaker right now ? most of the time , it is the friends they hang out with . young people are easily influenced by the people around them ."
did you get hurt ?
"nice , what year ?"
im sorry to hearyou were homeles
interesting . . . you sure it was not fish that washed up on the shore
"why , what happened to make you feel that"
oh wow that sucks ! hope it was not too embarassing !
that is great ! where are they working ?
that is scary ! hope you did not find yourself in the bad part of town
oh wow ! that is intense ! i am glad he did not get kicked out !
that is amazing . sounds like you have a really good support system .
that is pretty neat especially if it gives you good memories !
i do too . i wish we could have fall weather longer .
oh what happened instead ? did your friends throw you a party ?
that is awesome ! i can not wait until my student loans are paid off !
"oh , do not be ! just have faith in yourself and be confident that you can make it in ."
they do have nice bags ! i hope you are able to get one !
nice ! how are you celebrating for him ?
"yum ! sushi is so good , i am sure you will enjoy it ! i like the eel roll and spicy tuna roll ."
where are you going ? i would say if your gut is telling you that it is not good then i would suggest listening to it
a really nice piece of hair ? yikes . did you send it back ?
"oh dang , that is too bad . can you guys video call ?"
i am right there with you . i have always been a home body . i do not like going out as much . sometimes people say millennials and technology have disconnected people too much . . that could be true . but at least we re comfortable doin it .
"that is awesome , i was an early reader as well ! that is a great accomplishment ! !"
oh no ! i am so sorry ! are you able to be up for another one soon ?
it happens to the best of us ! i know the lady understands !
"sorry to hear that , i know that you probably feel disappointed but there will be other opportunities !"
do you have some uncertainty in you life right now ?
that is really tough . are you in a career now ?
do you have any opportunity for an internship of some sort ? the career advisers from your school may be able to help .
as in living alone or single ?
"oh wow , i am sorry to hear that ! put your leg up and relax this weekend !"
"that sounds really frustrating to deal with . you sound like you are self aware and anticipating the problem , though . perhaps you ve already started preparing to look elsewhere ?"
nice . did you find a good hairdresser ?
"i am sorry to hear that ! my dog is a part of the family , so i understand . i hope everything is okay ."
what did you do ?
that is great . where are you going ?
that is exciting . when is she due ?
yes it is ! is she having a boy or a girl ?
"i totally understand . life can sometimes seem overwhelming . i have learned to stop , take a deep breath , and do one thing at a time ."
yikes ! bet the car payment is not worth it . lol
"woah , hope she does not report you ! jk"
what are you applying for ?
what game and what kind of award
oh wow that is so exciting ! i am sure you are excited to move in .
you sound very content . what makes you happy ?
"oh no , i would have had a heart attack ."
"nice , how was it ?"
are you doing the cheesecake for your family ?
that is really nice ! you should show her you appreciate her . maybe cook her dinner !
ugh that must so inconvenient and uncomfortable !
"oh gosh , is he going to take you to the superbowl at least ?"
nice ! i want to take my daughter when she is older . did you go to disneyland or world ?
aww that is great !
oh naughty . did anyone see you ?
are you making a trip to see your family ?
that would definitely be a difficult thing to find out . how did you find out ?
"haha . . i feel like that is almost a rite of passage when going to water parks . i have had that happen , too . hopefully it was not too traumatic for you . i almost lost my glasses once , too ! now that was really scary"
i hate when that happens ! the same thing happened to me when i moved out of my apartment . they kept my security deposit because they needed to replace carpet .
"that is pretty awesome , congrats"
good on you . you need to be comfortable in your own skin and its not other people s business to tell you how to live .
did you get up to check it out ?
that is exciting
that is an amazing talent to have . i would be so scared !
i hope you did it . do not worry too much .
what happened ? hope you are okay ?
did you suffer any injuries ?
yeah i wanted to tell you about the time i was hit by a drunk driver im so happy to still be alive after that experience
sorry to hear ! do you have any idea about the break up ? did you think about it ?
which concert ?
"ugh , those articles always get me too . . . what was wrong with her ?"
that is nice of you . what did you do ?
"he will , i have faith ."
thats not good . do you own a gun ?
years is a long time . how come ?
that is not very nice .
thats horrible .
thats horrible . did you tell on him ?
"i guess it makes you appreciate things you used to take for granted , lol . but it does not last forever and is worth it ."
"oh , i am sure you are lonely . maybe you can join some kind of club that lets you meet new friends ?"
oh man . i am all about discipline ! i do not like spoiled bratty kids
did things end amicably ? i hope everything is good now !
that is a very blessed day . it is something you will never forget .
i bet that must have been nerve wracking until it happened .
oh really ? what happened with your family and friend then ?
"i agree , someimes we just know"
that is great ! how did they surprise you ?
"awww , that sucks man . hopefully they do not say mean things to you about being lonely ."
"yeah that is always odd to me , before they can talk they are already unique !"
"i understand that one , they are my favorite place to eat"
that must have been and intense and emotional moment for you .
i am sure it will ! i did not get along with my dad until i became an adult .
where you not secure in your self ?
"you can track her down to say sorry , or would that be creepy ?"
lucky you ! that is rare . maybe one day people will think of you like that ?
i have something totally different . my boss is clueless to the world and have no business being a leader .
it is crazy how quickly kiddos grow ! even in a few weeks time ! do you see your friend and her baby often ?
"wow , that is an amazing accomplishment ! congratulations ! you got ta be feeling like you are on top of the world after that !"
""
i am sorry to hear that ! how did you find out ?
i feel the same way .
oh no that is terrible ! how did your daughter take it ?
"ooo they are gon na love it , just its expensive , i remember when it was only to get in ."
cool . somethings never change . what did you reflect upon ?
i am trying to get into it . we have our first baby on the way and need to reorganize everything . do you have tips ?
"well , sometimes people are busy and do not have the time to check emails"
is not that what sisters are for ? what were you guys upset about ?
congratulations ! where did you travel from and where did you end up ?
"i know , that actually happens to me sometimes ! last year i did not get accepted into this fellowship and for a couple of weeks i was underestimating myself a lot ."
i totally understand why he was mad . why did you tell her ?
what is a back neighbor ? and that is crazy !
i understand . i am think the same thing . what is your health issue ?
"oh , it sure is , i feel the same way . they grow up so fast !"
i bet you were beautiful on that day . i hope that confidence has carried on since then !
i bet it is tough . a regular income is nice but the freedom you get from working for yourselfs is better .
oh ya ? what happened ? ? i am intrigued
oh i love the beach ! ! which beach are you going to go to ?
why did not you go ?
did he do anything to you and your mom ?
"no , you did not tell me ! what happened ?"

"who , tell me !"
that is very nice gift . did you bought anything for him for father s day ?
oh what job was the interview for ?

"oh no , what did you do ?"
"oh no , i hate when that happens . i can sympathize with you because thats happen to me twice ! its okay in the winter time and you can sort of keep your food fresh but not during the summer"
"wao , you must fell weird about it ! what you thinki to do about it ?"
"oh , i am sure you were embarrassed ! but , maybe you can laugh about it now ?"
"ah , that sounds fantastic ! which ocean will you be enjoying ?"
"well , that is impressive ! i can see why you are proud . sounds like a hard working young lady !"
absolutely i agree i always try to not even bring cart unless i have too many too carry .
oh wow . do you know whether it will be a boy or girl yet ?
what kind of work do you do ?
"i agree , its always nice to have people around you who are smarter in some areas"
"baby belugas are cute , but not as cute as your baby !"
"that is great ! ! sometimes we mom s get a bit forgotten , so to have an entire day where we are just loved is such a great feeling ."
"i am not sure , it was pretty random"
"no , nothing at all"
that is exciting news ! i bet you were so surprised !
i do watch netflix sometimes . do you watch ?
i have n t heard of that one . what genre does it fall in ?
did it go your way ?
"i hate traffic too , it makes me angry"
i can imagine ! that was a terrifying movie .
she sounds like a person with great ability . great choice of friend .
is that a bad sign ? perhaps the plant is not getting enough nutrition or sunlight ?
put what word ? you mean published the info ?
i would be too ! you did what you had to do !
do you find the home buying experience worth it ?
how long do you plan on staying in that house ?
"you should n t , because that is a very stressful job"
really ? do you know what you want to do when you graduate ? i know sometimes it is tough to settle on a path .
i am not sure . what would you do ?
"oh no , that sounds like an awful situation . what did you end up doing after that ?"
so exciting ! it can be fun to have a roommate
i have heard a lot of people say something similar . did you go there a lot ?
good lord you must have had facebook for a long time ! i started mine in college so there is not anything from my younger years .
oh ok lol . i completely understand . i had a friend share a post about making mix tapes from the radio with a cassette player . totally remember doing that !
"me too , bullies are part of the reason that i homeschooled ."
i also saw it and felt like it was pretty good . much better than the my little pony movie . that was torture .
that is not nice of them . why do they keep taking it ? ?
"lol ! this is perfect timing because i had the you are an adult not a child conversation with my girlfriend not too long ago . i had left popsicle wrapper on the night stand and it got sticky . i argued if you are willing to date someone who likes to eat popsicles in bed , then you have to deal with the consequences ."
wow . i am so sorry to hear that . that would be incredibly hard . what happened ?
that is horrible . i am really sorry about your friend .
that is a beautiful name ! it is cool you honored your friend in that way .
did you not have a car ? that is hard . i do not have one now and use uber and lyft all the time .
that is incredible ! i swear some things in life are determined by fate . i am glad you were able to get a car .
yes . my first was when i turned .
did you have candles or a flash light to help yous see ?
how did you do
pet ? like dogs and other ?
from where ?
i am so sorry . i can not imagine what you must have went through .
really ? what kind of work does he do ?
awww . . . reminds me of the show hoarders when the family members argue over silly things like that . what was the necklace all about did you make it or something ?
well why did you have it if it belonged to them ? did you pawn it ?
all the time . that is part of listening to music i suppose . the songs remind you of when you first heard them .
oh no ! what happened to it ?
it is so sad to know but my mother is rather sick of flu and not dying
did you get sick afterwards
damn that sounds like a pretty good one ! how did that turn out ?
i am so sorry to hear that . is there any chance you might be able to reconcile ? ? ?
oh that is too bad . i do not want to overstep but i always like to encourage people to hold on to their love for each other no matter what trials come up .
"i think that is good ! if you are meant to be together you will feel it and it will work out i think , if you just keep your conviction and stick with it . good luck with it !"
"so sad , you can never force someone to love you . you will find the right person for you ."
do you have a good chance with her . have you talked to her about it ?
"probably one where i got a limo with all my friends and went to this restaurant , it was great . what about yours , what makes your friends so great too ?"
hi are you there ?
oh my ! you must have been terrified ! did everything turn out ok ?
"i have not tried yet , but i feel like it would be enjoying and full of delight"
you are so lucky . mums are the best . what do you do for her ?
"nothing went wrong , we just have different lives in different places . i go visit every now and then ."
that is great that you have an awesome mom !
"ooh , am so sorry about that . have you tried to talk to her ?"
well i am a mover so i have to bring heavy furniture up and down stairs .
that is awesome . what are you majoring in ?
that is such a bummer . why did you keep watching them ?
i understand being fascinated by them they can be very intriguing . maybe you should stop watching as many though .
i like scary movies as well so i know how addicting they can be .
"oh yeah , donald trump is such a charlatan . he has some really shady history too . i am actually a christian and a conservative but i am appalled that everyone on the right have fallen for this guy . he s so against what the real conservative values are supposed to be ."
awwww . congratulations . what is your major
"that is interesting , how does he buy you stuff or is he just really nice ?"
"yes , i think they offer a great bridge to the past . do you ?"
i am very sorry . have you tried telling her how you feel ? that could affect her decision .
i am not quite following . anything you want to tell me about ?
that is really nice of her . it is nice to have someone to help you do things sometimes .
"that is so sad , i hope you ve gotten over it ."
"no , u do not have to be"
that is very special and i am so happy for you .
that is good to have a loving family .
"wow , years ? you were really young then"
oh no ! that must have been super embarrassing ! how did you react to that ?
"that sounds fun , starting a new life is always great !"
because she was what ?
i can imagine the loneliness someone can experience .
"wow , please make it real ."
who is supplying these snacks ?
why did she go visiting ?
that sounds horrible . you must ve been mad .
"well , it can happen like that atimes"
am sorry to hear that . what happened to the mother

"oh boy that is the worst , so frustrating ! has there been any change since ?"

"not being able to fit into an old wedding dress , is one of a womans worst nightmare ."
i like starbucks . but they are a little expensive for me to go there often .
"wao , thats great , congrats !"
"wow , that will be so devastating for you"
report to their management
"haha , how did she feel when she found out ?"
"dang , i hated that . at least it is not cow poop , that is worst ."
how do you make it ?
congrats ! what gender did your child end up being ?
"do not panic , and do not be harsh on the kid . perhaps spend time going over the subject together ? or maybe he s having other trouble that is affecting his studies"
that is cool . for what class
"wow . i would be too . i love guitar , it is my favorite musical instrument . i wonder if he was born blind"

"you must feel awful , why do not you come clean , maybe you will feel better ."
"he deserved that , i think ."
"wow , you must have felt jealous"
"when you have responsibilities that you really care about , you do what you have to . i commend him . its hard raising a family ,"
oh wow . ive never heard of that many sick days .
"so , what was she lying to you about ?"
oh no how horrible
i hate public schools ooo

i am so sorry to hear that ! is there a particular section you are having trouble with ?
ah ! that is quite understandable . it is tricky at first and non intuitive . i practiced driving in reverse with cones in an abandoned lot .

thats creepy honestly
nice ! what job is going for

"i can only imagine having to wait at the table alone , wondering if she d show up . at least , it sounds like , she finally arrived . did she specify a reason for being so late ?"
"ahhh ! me too , there is so much that can be done on the weekends !"
"actually that has happened to me , during thanksgiving"

what kinds of things are you talking about ?
i have been there many times .
wow that is a long time ago .
that is so disgusting . i hate seeing that !
that sounds really painful ! you should pick them up .
"qdoba is the bomb ! although , i think i prefer chipotle slightly more ."

that sucks . maybe it is time to get new friends ?
"i know exactly what you mean . my sister is entering her teenage years . i feel like it is all i can do to just not be annoying to her , so i can not even imagine what it is like for a mom ."

"oh goodness , what happened for the past weeks ?"
sorry to hear this ! i can understand your pain .
"i am sure it will be fine , do you have a preference"
"that is good , it is very important to be loyal in a healthy relationship !"
you should channel that envy into motivation !
that is a great attitude to have ! it is great to have an optimistic approach to life .
"oh poor thing , is she at least getting better ?"
"i see , you must have felt hopeful"
thats adorable how old is she ?
that is a pretty heavy realization . . . better tell him now that regret it later
what are your options ?
"it is an excellent opportunity , to know other people and places , to open up to the possibility , i assure you that it will go to you very well"
"that sounds like it is rough , did your father accept your apology ?"
it happens we have to reward ourselves sometimes . dark chocolate is actually good for you !
that is awesome
i totally feel you on that . i swear my neighbors have to be the loudest at night slamming their car doors and yelling outside right in front of my bedroom window .
did you retrace your steps
that is great ! i bet they are equally excited if not more are you travelling alone ?
"i would be too , that is a long time !"
wow did youcall someone about that ?
"oh my , did they notice you farted ?"
"i am sorry , how have you been passing the time"
that is a very optimistic way to look at life . i should actually look at life that way too instead of getting overwhelmed when things do not go my way
how long have you looked at life this way ? is it sustainable ?
this is completely true . it involves totally re conditioning the mind .
i am so very sorry . have you had time to talk about it
"ooh , that is a big jump . i was considering the same thing , but i one state above"
"yes , realistically i wish it were possible to do that everyday but general stresses of life get in the way"
do you have any hobbies that may help you to meet people ?
you must be ver
where are you going
sounds like you made the right decision . what a bunch of a holes
free pizza is good ! how did you get it ?
it was fine how about you ?
i am not sure i feel comfortable telling you as we just met .
my day was great so far ! how about you ?
oh that sucks maybe organize the socks better ?
that is great ! when will you find out ?
"i know how it feels to be homesick , but you have to put your wife first ."
"ohh man , that is a long time to be alone . what are you going to do while she is gone ?"
what happened ? did someone bump on your car ?
that must have been awkward .
"nostalgia can be wonderful , can not it ?"
what was going on ! ?

thar was an embarasing moment for sure

what are you worrying about ?
what is your favorite memory with your friends ?
you deserved for graduating .
i am glad to hear you have something you can lean on in hard times . i am personally an atheist but i can respect someone with faith .
"oh man , i am sorry to hear that ! it does not necessarily mean it went bad , though . maybe they just had a more qualified candidate ?"
i am not jealous of my co worker though ? what makes you think i am jealous ?
"that would be sad , do you keep him in a cage ?"
absolutely . although the world is not so black and white . sometimes a person may have to steal to survive . is it really wrong then ?
"that is so sad , i am so sorry you had to go through that . how did it happen ?"
do you have some big plans for the visit ?
"uh oh , have you ever delivered a baby before ?"
"oh right , i am a doctor ."
what was the accomplishment again ?
what about this homeless person had you reevaluating things ?
oh no ! i hope it did not fall on anything or anyone !
who ? ? ? male or female . actor or singer ?
"i know exactly how you feel , i have been slipping back into paycheck to paycheck living recently . it was so much better when i had the money to pay for everything ."
"wow , that is terrible . was anything stolen or damaged ?"
that is is awful . did you call the cops
that is rough man . got any back up interviews lined up ?
"oh no , that is terrible ! what happened ? what did you do !"
"yuck , sounds like an unpleasant feeling . how do you even get hair up there !"
oh really ? ! where you headed too ?
did you have a severe diarreia or something ?
oh cool ! how did you win it ?
"wow that is annoying , my husband is always telling me about his co workers being the same way ."
sometimes it is uncomfortable to have to wait for something or someone .
i think you should always focus on your strength then it will not matter who is there and what they say
"that is great , how wonderful ! i hope y all had a good time ."
how old was the child ?
oh that is not good . it is hard to put all your effort in and have it go nowhere

"i am in the same boat , but i think that i can still be very happy and very content with the little bit of money or lack of i have ."
how funny ! i know how you feel though . i have always been poor .
why ? how did that happen ?
that is so sad . i feel sorry for you .
"that is nice , i am glad you feel that way ."

i certainly do . lucky to be healthy and able
i hope you get the job ! what was the position you applied for ?
no . why do you ask ?
i actually do not have any kids right now

"well that is good , sometimes it is our failures that really show us what we re made of ."
did you say anything to someone ?
"no , i do not have kids . yours ?"
wow . thats hard to believe lol .
"that must of been a pain ! i hate waiting in lines for cashiers , they are so slow sometimes ."
"man , i am so jealous of you . i love that new puppy stage , as tumultuous as it can be . there is just so much emotion and new feelings going on as you watch it grow ."

time sure does fly and change is inevitable

"that is very good to hear , hopefully things truly turn around for him ."

"oh that is nice , i love doing that . did the cat seem happy ?"
wow that must have been scary !
"wow back up there friend , what are you talking about ?"
"context , what the heck are you talking about ?"
"being jealous of another person is a perfectly fine response . despite this , you never know what is going on behind the scenes , she may have taken out huge loans just to fund her trips ."

"oh no ! i am not sure how all that works , but i thought that was fairly normal for a pregnat woman"
that is so sad . you did your best . how old was she ?
was he with you or just someone you wanted to be with ?
"oh , wow , i wish my parents had done that ! it would have saved me from the mountain of debt i have now"

the rap version ? does not sound all that appealing to me . was it that good ?
how did that go
optimism is the faith that leads to achievement
"i am not , i am still young"
"i have anxiety attacks too , you feel like you cant catch your breath and you are light headed ."
do not worry . it will be okay . flights are always safe
that will be such a wonderful feeling when you do . i know it is hard when you see someone reach the finish line first are you able to turn that envy into inspiration ?
"i am like that too , so i can totally relate . were you able to talk to him about how you felt ?"
"oh , that must be exciting ! i bet you were busy making preparations ."
wow . . what do you plan to do ?
oh really ? how did it go ?
that sounds exciting ! congratulations to her . i bet there was a lot of celebration to be had for such an achievement !
did that person betrayed you in any way ?
"i love reuniting with old friends , helps me remember and appreciate the good times ."
i am sure you studied hard and should be proud of that ! i am positive you nailed it .
how did you meet your friend ? !
that is unfortunate . i hope that it is able to be treated well .
"wait , were they leaving to go somewhere or like dying ? either one is a little sad to be honest ."
what happened to him ? are you guys roommates ?
how did they lose so much weight compared to you ?
getting out of town and way from all of everday life s struggles always sounds like a great time . did you leave you cell phone at home while you weer away to really get away from everything for a minute ?
no refunds for a cancel week before ? that sounds like a total scam ! i would be furious . did you ever find a way to get your money back ? because that does not sound legal !
lovely . what did you do together ?
that must feel lonely . you should go out and try to meet some people !
that is frightening ! especially if you did not know whether it was a harmful spider or not ! what did you do ?
"wait , summers already over ? next summer ?"
"you should get a mini fridge and put it in your room , with a lock on it ."
"wow , that truly is devastating . i wish your family can make it through these hard times"
amen to that . life is so unfair it is not even funny .

do you still talk with any of your older friends ?
yikes what was it about ?
that is great . i bet it is a very special place for you two .
at least riley passed in their sleep . hopefully they did not suffer . i am sorry you lost a loved one .
i absolutely agree . i really hope he does not win in .
"dang , that sucks . maybe they can visit you instead ?"
i guess you do not live in alabama ? was it overall a good trip . . . . or challenging ? or both !
that is the worst ! ! i know that you must have been very frustrated with your teammate .
i hate bees and wasps so much . maybe you should call pest control ?
"wow , it must have been quite an experience"
awesome . what breed did you own ?
minutes is a good time to be able to change a tire . i do not think i could change a tire own my own .
i would be too ! did you to it ?
you must be so proud !
what state are you going to move to ?

so sorry to hear that . . may i ask how did it happen ?
"oh , that is awful . what did you do ? i would ve dumped her and beat that dude s face in ."
oh nice . did you have a good time ?
i do not have a normal job anymore but that would frustrate me as well .
oh the broadway musical ? i heard really good reviews of it

"i understand . horror movies freak me out , too . did you watch the whole thing ?"
how long ago did that happen ?
she must not have loved you
was the weather good ?
perhaps try telling the person how it makes you feel
that sounds nice . how often does this usually happen ?
was it for your birthday ?
"its just the way the world is now , social media has ruined humanity"
have you told them how you feel ?
that must have been so annoying . hopefully you can just get a replacement .
"that is so annoying , some people just dont have morals"
how does it get you into trouble ?

that is the best kind of day .
"i am so sorry to hear about riley , i know he was an important part of the family . how is everyone holding up after the news ?"
i can empathize with you there . do you think there might be another way to let her know ?

"thats awesome to hear , a lot of people cheat on each other frequently and dont care anymore"
"that is awful , but better safe than sorry . how were things when you came back ?"
that is terrible . i thought they had to offer some sort of alternative . what airline was it ?
you are so lucky to be talented enough to achieve such an honor . was it as wonderful as you had imagined it would be ?
do you have any kids ?
was it at college ?
that sounds like a really stressful situation . it is really good to know that there are still helpful people out there !
who do you support ?
oh no ! what did you do ?
oh that is super excited ! i am sure you are really proud of him .
what a nice guy . there are fewer and fewer of those every day .

nice . did you like it ?
"it was who , who were them ?"

oh no ! were you gone for long ?
i can hear the sigh of relief in your voice . i bet your anxious about what the next chapter will be .
i can tell your proud of yourself . im happy for you !
you will be fine ! stay optimistic about it
it is good you are motivated ! that is a step in the right direction
that is amazing and a very quick profit ! i am a little bit jealous myself .
yikes . did you get injured ?

nice ! what genre of playlist was it ?
i can only imagine ! how is he now ?
that is great news ! i bet you are glad to get a fresh start somewhere new .
"oh , how he reacted next"
"yes , that will be awesome ! how long has it been since you ve seen everyone ?"
that is a great accomplishment . i admire your dedication in obtaining that goal .
that great to hear ! have you started a work out program before ?
"sounds impressive , does he mainly play for fun or is he in competitions ?"
oh no what happened ?
that would really help if it was a permanent solution
yeah enough is enough . i totally can not say i blame you .
i hate creepy stuff like that because i get paranoid .
that will be an amazing trip ! !
christmas was always a nightmare for me .
that is great ! it is so awesome to feel confident after an interview !
was it a ghost ?
"that is great , keep it up if you can !"
"man , i wish i could get one ."
have you ever sold on craigslist before ? i always have the people meet me in the walmart parking lot during the day . i have sold hundreds of things and have never had an issue like that .
is it loud where you are now ? new places are always so fun !
oh no ! how did that happen and how much damage did they do ?
that is truly all you can ask for .
"wow , impressive . you must have natural talent . do you plan to make more ?"
i bet ! is it hard to have a long distance relationship ?
"aww . it is the things money can not buy that bring us the greatest joy , no ?"
"dogs really are such great companions , what breed is she ?"
how come ? it will probably be an exciting adventure for you to start
i do the same ! i think everyone does .
that is the way to do it ! be prepared to kick it is butt and get good grades !
whoa that is exciting ! what kind of car we looking at ?
thats awesome ! what kind of car do you want
"that is annoying , i hate how little attention most other drivers pay on the road ."
i can imagine . how old will they be ?
now that you what ? tell me !
that is great ! did you get anything you are especially excited about ? it is a restaurant and a store ?
dragon tongue beans ! i have never heard of them ! what do they look like ?
"i will have to look for those . we have a huge variety of foods where i live , but this is new to me ."
how did he scare you ?
oh that sounds disgusting !
"i think we never really know what is going on inside people s mind . celebrities like anthony and robin williams seems to live a good life , but in reality , they are suffering ."
i completely agree ! i think it would even help lower crime rates .
oh no . i am so sorry . can you video chat with her ?
"wow ! that is insane , too bad you did not bet with those kind of odds ."
yeah the older they get the more teachers they usually get . i think it is good because they get a variety .
i can understand that as i live in florida and we prepare for hurricanes each year with a plan and emergency rations and supplies .
"that is wonderful , they say children have a certain gift for picking up languages ."
did you think about moving after that ?
oh wow ! i hope that it was ok !
that is very unusual . she should be proud of herself .
i have n t watched actual tv in sooo long . what do you watch on hulu ?
"aw , i bet he feels horrible about it . poor kitty !"
that would be horrific . do you know someone that this happened to ?
that is nice of your friend . i hope you enjoyed it .
do you have any idea where you will go ? is it accompanied ?
"i am with you on this one . what is up with people these days , i just do not understand how they could do that ."
"i had a similar experience , i miss it too"
"i know that when just the people in my family do go out , it runs us about . so we do it very rarely , it wastes a lot of money ."
where to ?
it is better to be safe than sorry . you can not overprepare .
i bet ! i hope you were able to catch up !
"that is strange , i hope she makes it out ok this time though ."
i am sorry to hear that . i hope she passed peacefully .
that was a really smart call on your part ! were you worried ?
that sounds pretty stressful . are you moving soon ?
that is great ! you are lucky !
nice ! which ones did you hear !
how did you do ?
that is great ! can you call him and see if we could all celebrate together ?
"well yeah , that sounds about right . he has to go to the championship first and win , then party time ! ! ! ! !"
that is sound like a lot of fun ! do you know where i can go get lessons ?
nothing wrong with that . i am definitely with you on the organizational front . i bet they are not laughing when you get them out of a jam !
oh man that is really annoying ! have you found another one you like yet ?
oh no ! do you know why ?
"do you know he is coming , or is it just blind luck ?"
wow . that is quite an accomplishment ! congratulations !
what has she been doing ? undercover cia agent ?
"ha , yeah got ta make sure the house is back up to wife code before she gets home . . . other wise there is going to be a price to pay ."
"i am sorry to hear that , my wife has done the same thing . she wore a hat for almost a month when she left the house ."
that does not sound good . what happened that was so bad ?
"oh lord . did you try to set it back up , or did you try to sneak away ?"
i know you are happy
that sucks . why did you move from california ?
that is really common actually . there is a big exodus from there . they voted for high taxes and now people are abandoning the state beacuse the cost of living is too high .
"the weather is nice in parts of california , i have been there ."
that is a long trip . did you do it all in one go or did you take breaks ?
"oh , poor lady . i do hope she s feeling better . what was wrong with her , if you do not mind my asking ?"
"why was it boring , nothing exciting to do where you live ?"
"what kind of operation is it ? i am unfamiliar with weight loss surgery . but typically surgeries like that are very safe , but it is natural to feel nervous about someone you care about ."
"yeah , that is never fun . did you lose at something recently ?"
"that is great , what specifically has made it so good for you ?"
thats so sad oh no ! thats terrible .
"awww , i totally know that feeling . i hate even going on vacation and not being able to bring my dog along . she is family !"
it must have been ! have you guys been apart before ?
you must be so thankful !
when will you be going ?
just cause of the way they look or you had an incident involving one ?
that sounds like a pleasant surprise !
"that is a terrible waste of food , how old is your little brother ?"
"that is brutal , did she get out ?"
awful ! did you complaint ?
"that is annoying , was it garlic bread ?"
how so ?
that is so sad . i have lost dogs before . i know how you feel
yeah dogs are man s best friend .
yes i have got one . she s a stray that showed up to work one day .
oh wow haha that is not good
what grade is he in ?
that is amazing ! how long have you been running ?
"i am right there with you . . i still feel pretty introverted , but since coming to college , i have been forced to socialize more , and it is help me at least fake it until i make it . i still prefer to be alone a lot of the time , but at least i can somewhat manage without making myself look dumb . maybe you can just think of some topics things to talk about to have in the back of your head for the times when things get quiet ?"
that sounds awesome . have you ever been before ?
"how d it turn out ? congrats on deciding to lead a healthier life , by the way ."
"yeah i have , it was not serious but i got rearended"
that is very sad . did something recently happen to her ?
"death by a thousand cuts , i call it ! they ll try to make a buck off anything !"
"yes , i have . one that actually died and one that was miraculously saved . it was a dark and tough time . did that happen to you recently ?"
"yeah , i have . do you ?"
always sucks when you forget to save it and wake up to a melted blob of brown .
thats horrible ! you should tell them as that is their property . what if someone did that to your stuff ?
"i know how you feel , financial problems are rough . i know you will figure out a way to make it ."
"that is awesome , what was in it ?"
ugh ! i hate it when stuff like that happens . were you able to get a refund on your tickets ?
awesome ! !
"i hate that too , what were you going to do ?"
why do not you believe him ? he made have been quite the big name back in his day .
that sounds interesting . what kinds ?
is that like the child equivalent of under the bed ?
"wow , that took some guts ! what made you want to cut it ?"
"ahhhh ! i have done that before , but i noticed it quick . did you not know til the end of the day ?"
please tell me it was not full of oriental trading company rubber ducks and cheap tchotchkes .
how did you do ?
"i understand , anything you need to talk about ?"
how is she doing
i can not believe christmas is in months it is crazy
well the casino won ! did you at least get some free drinks ?
i do hate when the lights are off too
i am happy for you . are you excited ?
are you ready for it ?
"that must be annoying for you , but i love cats ."
oh that is great ! congratulations on your upcoming finish !
ohh what happened ?
i know exactly what you mean . it gets so lonely on the road . have you had to go away recently ?
"on to the next one , as they say !"
"oh yeah . i have never seen it , i can not watch horror films . how did you like it ?"
that is scary when that happens
why is that ?
"whoa , that is scary ! did you know him ?"
"hahaha , sounds kind of like clickbait"
"that is weird but amazing ! does it work ? if it does , i will get my husband to tape his mouth shut . he snores like a freight train because his tongue slides back i guess . is that true for you ?"
that sounds like a nice time !
did you go over and ask them to turn down the volume ?
i know what you mean . once i had a bank where the teller s literally had butts for heads . it was so distracting trying to talk to them .
wow thats nostalgic ! ! . it must have brought back lot of good memories
what happened ?
thats not strange at all
"oh no , the poor girl . was she able to walk afterwards ?"
hahaha why was it underwhelming ?
why were you getting mad ? were you not lifting as much as you wanted ?
you are good at generalizing are not you ?
how much did you win ?
that sounds cool .
what did you name her ?
oh you must have enjoyed it ! !
so cute ! what kind of dog is it ?
that is crazy did you ever get it back ?
"eww , it may be time to call someone to take care of them ."
how creepy !
that is rough . did you end up getting the job ?
that is strange . what did you discover under there ?
oh no ! are you okay ?
oh yeah ? is it on par with i have a dream ?
wow that was really nice of them
"that is great , man ! did you study hard for it ?"
"aw , that is awesome , did it bring back memories ?"
nice ! who did you go see ? did you catch a homerun ?
oh dang . was she a hoarder ? what did you find ?
oh that is terrible . is he alright ?
i do love a smooth ride . what kind of car is it ?
"wow , you were dedicated , did you do well on it ?"
that must of been pretty stressful . but did you get enough sleep ?
that is terrible ! did you get it back with everything still inside ?
"i agree . i think i am one of them , considering i gave my whole life savings to charity yesterday ."
"that is good to hear , what did she do to make you proud ?"
sorry to hear that . maybe you can talk with your boss about changing the schedule a bit .
that is awesome . what are you hoping to do ?
are you cleaning out a house or do you not have garbage pick up ?
oh really ? what was it they served ?
i hope she hears some good news . is it pretty serious ?
"oh no , it is awful something happens on that special day that should be full of joy and whatnot ."
"am sorry about that , what are others doing about it"
old school video games are full nostalgic memories for me . that is why i try to avoid them as they evoke many emotions in me
i love beer ! i wish i could try your guy s beer . is it a hard process ?
"ooh , you should not be , she should be appreciated for looking good"
"oh , i have n t read it , but i was also sad to hear he passed"
"aw , that is so nice of them ! was it fun ?"
ohhh . . i would love that experience ! how special !
oh geez ! why was she gone for so long ?
how long have you been there ?
that does not seem fair . how are they getting around not paying you for it ?
"wow , did you ever get them in trouble ?"
"great , what is his field ?"
sounds super relaxing ! i bet your enjoying it !
"my brother just graduated and is on the job hunt , and he s described his experience as the same thing . . seems like he has good interviews and they are receptive to him , but they do not really respond or give him an answer . sorry to hear you guys go through that . can not imagine how frustrating it is"
that sounds like so much fun !
i totally get why you feel that way . your time will come soon .
that is good ! i bet you missed her a lot .
that is a long time to kind of hang in limbo . i am sorry you had to endure that for a month .
"aw , i bet you miss her a lot ."
what kind of job is it ?
aw man that sucks how come he gets to get one but not you
when does she return ?
did you go running like crazy ! ?
"they are bad now too , they are so annoying"
"come on , the worst that can happen is that it kills you ."
"wow , are you nervous at all"
"that kind of stinks . sorry to hear that ! well , at least there are worst things to forget outside . . maybe this is an easy learning lesson !"
yikes that sounds scary but overall good for the end results . how do you feel about it ?
that is a good friend you got there .
what types of situations are you referring to ?
i am so sorry to hear that . was she able to go surrounded by you guys ?
where did they go ?
that is great ! i have got to deal with loud neighbors too . anything specific they do ?
"oh wow , i bet you can not wait ! i remember when i had to spend a summer overseas and it was awful to be away from my husband ."
could you elaborate as to why ?
i am sure you will do great ! how long have you been training ?
"i can imagine , i have been there and it is the worst just belive in yourself"
that sounds like fun ! i have always wanted to visit india .
that sounds like a relief .
"it seems like it is a lot of ruckus , i have visited friends who have your situation and i can only imagine ."
glad you enjoyed that short period of peace . maybe soon you will get new neighbors or you can get a better place .
omg i would have been so embarrassed ! o
"that is awesome , i hope that happens to me on my next trip , where where you going"
"i would go mad , were you away at college or in the service ?"
that is not silly at all ! i am sure he ll love it .
did it turn out how you expected it
maybe put the poop back on your neighbors yard ?
"that is wonderful , it is always good when hard work pays off like that !"
"oh wow , that sounds like it was a big mess ."
oh yeah ? did you go give it a try ?
that can be a bit uncomfortable for sure . did you try and avoid conversations
he must be really strong !
that is hard thing to go through . i hope you are feeling better about it now .
"aw , that sucks . but at least he got a job , right ?"
oh my . that is very unfortunate .
"that must have been a little bit of a roller coaster . that is kind of why i am not wild about cats , is because they are so independent , and the outside cats can just go hang out somewhere for days and not have a care in the world about you . but i guess that suits some people ."
"my nephew is getting into golf ! it seems like a cool enough sport , albeit a little expensive . i hope you are able to get back to playing again . i have taken up running and swimming , and it is interesting how much those physical activities relieve stress in our day ."
"i have never been skydiving myself . i hear that it is a great experience , but i am not sure if i have the bravery for it ."
"sounds like fund , you must be excited !"
that sounds horrible . i would not have been able to sleep after that .
"well , it is okay to be a bit nervous . interviewers will understand that . you only have to halfway reign in it in and you will hit that happy medium that is good for a workplace interview . where are you applying to ?"
did you tell anyone about the dream ?
you should call your best friend on the telephone !
oh that sounds like fun
oh my ! ! what are you going to do ? i would buy it anyway .
it happens to the best of us . it would be great if they did not make us gain weight .
"oh no , poor baby"
that sounds really fun . can you still remember some of the routines ?
"i am fascinated by how people can watch golf , i always found it really boring , but if you enjoy it then great !"
"aw that is terrible , at least you were able to comfort her ?"
oh my god ! what did you do ? did you tell anyone ?
me too ! ! ! ii never could understand what drives people to be so mean to such innocent creatures .
"oh , i hate it when that happens . did you find out what it was ?"
"you do ? thats good , friends can be terrible people to lend too ."
i bet that was scary . did he surprise you with something ?
does it look like a space ship ?
what does she do ?
"aw i understand that , i have gone through that myself and it is very hard . when did this happen ?"
"oh no , have you been able to calm yourself down ?"
"that does not sound plpeasant at all , maybe they should relocate those who are staying there ."
"i bet you are , that is some pretty good foresight right there ! did you have to use it this past winter ?"
well good luck with that !
do roller coasters scare you
that is a bummer . maybe next time you can join them .
"goodness , you are right about that . plus a pet is the only thing to show unconditional and neverending love for you ."
"it is the worst waiting for vacations ! you want the time before to go fast but then it to go slow during . never works out that way , unfortunately ."
and how is she doing now
aww that is too bad . i hope you got some solid netflix in at least !
oh that sounds fun !
did you find any good companies .
it is okay ! try to rest on the couch and that might help !
that must have been scary . is that the first time it has happened to you ?
i am sure that he will turn up soon . i really hope that you find him .
"aww , i am sorry to hear that . was it a bad break up or did you part on good terms ?"

"that sucks , will she not let you see the dog at all ?"
yeah it really does . it is even worse to try and close those accounts !
oh that is awesome . what does she do ?
congrats to your friend ! that is an amazing accomplishment .
do not be . i am sure you raised him right . he will be starting his new adventure
i am sure he s cool as a cucumber while you are a nervous wreck . it will be fine .

did you go to the doctor
"well , did you eat her ice cream ?"
i wonder who actually ate it then .
you will be fine . its going to be hard but dont beat yourself up over it .
"that would be pretty cool to see , but you should know that typically most cats swish their tail when they are annoyed or angry ! it did not attack you , did it ?"
"nice , i guess the only times i was nervous to take a test was when i was not prepared , but there is only so much preparation you can do until you just have to trust your brain or whatever"
"i bet it does bud , i know the feeling . so how do you deal with it"
sometimes they cant avoid it

"wow , is that true ? that is pretty amazing ! i would say science should know about your dog ."
"dang , that is a lot of dogs . cleaned out the pound , you did . but that does not hold a candle to the i ate yesterday ."

it is not crazy ! i am all about cleaning up . i love the smell of clean house
that is good . i know that would be difficult .
"that is always both an exciting time and a nerve wracking time . i am in college and i had to move the past two years in a row . this year , i decided i kinda had enough and would just stay put , even though the apartment was just so so . do you like it well enough even if the neighbors may give you trouble ?"

"haha , that is a nice way to enjoy a sad moment , how are you feeling recently ?"
"oh my , you must have been annoyed with your cat . i guess he just wanted your attention ."
"what prize was it , or what was the competition , rather ? i am interested to know , but do not want to pry , if you do not feel like saying ."
was it any good ?
i bet it is ! when my grandma was alive it was so heartbreaking to see her in pain . she broke her hip right before her death and she just could not recover

"that is a terrible tragedy , my friend . did the dog get sick ?"

"i hope you are ok , what happened ?"
that is always fun ! did you get anything cool ?
"nice , how did it go ? was the guy nice ?"
that sucks . do you know what caused the outage ?
oh nice ! that seems more likely than winning the state lottery . that would be so cool if you won !
were they a close friend ? and did you pay them with pizza ?
sorry to hear that . what would you do if you won it ?
"oh , was it good ? i have considered it ."
"that would take a miracle , or have some major money backing it ."
"im sorry to hear that , how long did you have him ?"
what happened ?
oh no ! did you lose a lot of work ?
im a browns fan i feel that pain
you should probably go to the doctor about that
"i bet that was fun , who did you go see ?"
oh that is wonderful ! is it a job that you would enjoy ?
"that is good , what are you going to do to celebrate"
"aww , that was sweet of her . does she do that often for you ?"

"well hopefully he is understanding , if he is anything like my brother nothing a cold pack will not fix ."
that is a great idea ! how is it so far ?
thats great
"that is good , did you have to wait there or were you able to go home ?"
"im sorry , thats awful . its a shame his parents arent being more supportive"
that was really nice of them . i bet you are appreciative .
"yikes ! that is terrible ! what a awful thing to do ! i am glad he finally got busted ! wow , for years , huh ?"
"i enjoyed highschool , too ."
i am sorry for your loss . i hope you can find comfort during this difficult time .
"happens to everybody . my girlfriend , who is the smartest person i know , has had to make duplicates of her car keys because she s locked herself out so much . she s so forgetful because she s so efficient and on top of everything else important , that sometimes she misses the small things . maybe that is true in your case , too !"
wow . that must be a very special friend . i net you were surprised .
oh that is just a recipe for disaster of the time .
"hm , who might that be ?"
oh my goodness ! that is amazing ! congratulations ! was it your first gold medal race ?
that sounds exciting and scary . what was the surprise ?
"that is cool , did it bring back some good memories ?"
"oh no , did you get hurt ?"
so what did you do ?
i am sorry . my wife could sympathize with you since i am gone a lot on business as well .
just be confident and you will do great !
"ah , yeah moving can be hectic ! are you moving somewhere you want to be ?"
oh no ! ! ! did you see what happened to the dog ? !
i can understand the anxiety . its a whole new different experience for first timers !
aww ! that is so cute ! has he done something special this week that made him extra sweet ?
good ! what is been going on ?
yeah exactly ! music is awesome .
"never too old or too manly to snuggle a stuffed animal . my mom said i used to carry this blanket with me when i was a toddler , everywhere i went . i wish i still had it . if i did , i would consider using it again , or at the very least passing it down to my own kid . what is the harm , you know ? if something gives you comfort and does not bother anyone else , there should be no shame ."
"aw ! that is horrible , i am sorry to hear that ."
"oh no ! that is really creepy , why is he in your backyard ?"
i am so sorry to hear that . it can not be easy for you and your family .
what shows are your favorite ? that must be nice .
good choice . you are health is more important than some grad degree .
"ah , i hate when that happens ! how embarrassed were you ?"
"you are sweet , what kind of soup did you make him ?"
i bet that was a little embarrassing .
wow ! what kind of meeting is it ?
"oh no , was it romantic texts ?"
that must be weird to talk to your ex still .
nice ! it feels good to be confident . when do they come out ?
why ? what happened to it ? is it okay ?
oh yeah ? do you know someone that lives there ?
yeah . that is awesome that you do that though . makes for some special moments with your daughter and teaches her stuff .
that sounds cool ! i bet she cooks good !
i am so happy for you that you have someone you can trust so completely .
did he get accepted ? i hope so
"oh wow , how did your mother handle this , how did you handle it . i can only imagine the pain ."
where did he go study at ? i can imagine how hard that could be . but it is good to see him following his dreams
"aww that is amazing , i am going on vacation next week and i can not wait"
do you have any special welcome back events planned ?
how exciting ! i hope everything goes as planned !
aww . im sure you must feel proud of him
that is good news . its always good when what you learn helps you get ahead
an adult did this ?
"aww , they grow up so fast ! ! how did she do ?"
what went wrong ?
i understand . did you told your friend ?
did you go see who it was ?
that is great . what is it fun ?
i am single and never been married . i assume arguments are part of marriage .
in some ways that is a bit funny but it certainly can be a scary time to come home alone to an empty dark house .
i do not think you should feel too bad about missing one day ! it sounds like you are generous regularly . i get it though .
children are a beautiful thing for us parents . what a great memory you have of that .
in what do you believe ?
what car did you buy ?
good luck ! my sister in law has been with weight watchers for a while now . she loves the camaraderie and how everyone encourages each other .
that test seems so hard . i probably could not even pass it . how did you do ?
that must have been nice . i keep cards too .
"of course not . there is so much paper in this house . i keep cards , photos , school projects . everything . we arent here forever"
i found lots of things to pass down when my grandmother passed . i think they passed down their hoarding to us lol
why was it slippery
oh no . why are you keeping the secret ?
oh i am sorry . did you get any part ?
"that is wonderful , i imagine she is very excited ."
"okay i see well , take your time she will be getting her liscense soon"
she just needs to get her confidence and i am sure you are a great teacher .
that can be overwhelming . are you going to be cleaning all day then ?
thats neat . do you guys make a lot of money ?
i wish my siblings were like that . we should be more supportive and close like that
i am jealous lol
wow ! it sounds like your kid is quite smart and gifted ! you must be really proud of him !
are you able to learn the route first before you have to take it for your job or are they kind of just throwing you into it ?
thats sad . have you been to scotand since ?
im sorry to hear that . were you born there ?
! wow . thats a full life !
excellent ! are you enjoying it ?
i am glad that she is living close to you . that must make you feel special . my mom is dead so i understand how you feel .
are they typically bad or something ?
thats awesome . what did you guys do ?
poor thing ! what did you do ? did you take it home with you ?
that s nice of you . did you keep it as a pet
that is a nerve racking experience . but i am betting you did graduate and did just fine !
"i am sure she understands , just tell the truth !"
oh boy . did you not get the memo that you were supposed to be wearing a dress ?
"oh man , i did too . i still do every once in a while but only when i am having trouble sleeping . does one stand out from the rest that you remember vividly ?"
so you probably felt pretty guilty huh . did you return what you stole ?
"i have always liked the idea of meditation , but i feel like it d be hard . my mind is always racing !"
"me too , do you have any special plans ?"
is it for college ?
i love cooking ! what types of things do you like to cook ?
those are so much fun . was everyone hype ?
"oh my gosh , so tiny . i am hoping since he was released from the hospital he is doing well now ?"
that is really nice that you guys have that trust .
i hope it did not mess up your clothes . i am sure it was a mistake .
oh no . i rent also so i know your pain . my last landlord was awful . how did your landlord react ?
lucky you did that in time !
wow ! you should do something back for her !
was it something important that you took ?
"that is awful , i am sorry to hear that . is he doing better now ?"
"life was easier back then , hopefully you still love life ?"
"oh , no ! what happened ? did she just get loose ?"
what ?
that is embarrassing . i would hate to have that happen .
ouch ! i can relate . what made you decide to drink a whole gallon in a day ?
"sheesh that is brutal , did you smack him ?"
"me neither , i hate it when they just wont leave you alone"
"always try to brush your teeth at least twice a day , it helps"
"that is bizarre , have you had this seen about ?"
you sound a lot like my husband . he is really into going to the gym . life isnt right if he doesnt get gym time .
"i have been skydiving , too ! it was a fun experience ."
"that is great , did something recently happen ?"
what possibilities do you speak of ?
i have never been much for meditating . i am glad you enjoy it .
i think that is a good idea so you are not always dependent on others to have fun and just enjoy time to yourself .
"i used to struggle with the same problem , it can be overwhelming"
grats . how long have you been working out for ?
that sounds nice . hopefully it is not too hot for you .
that is just so sad . house fires are terrifying to me .
did it go flat ?
that is really nice of you ! is the cat ok now ?
i think that is a lovely thing
"yea , its a good idea to take time for yourself when you can"
yeah as a child it is hard to see other kids with a bunch of friends when you do not have that many .
"oh man ! thats impressive , those baths are rough ."
are you taking protein ?
"i agree , were you recently screwed by one ?"
"that is sweet of you , kids are cute"
wow i have n t thought of them in years . sometimes it is good to have bands you can always go back to
nice ! are you getting a car soon too ?
that is awful . i have had it happen to me once before .
"yeah . . . that seems like a hard gig , especially in today s day and age , where everyone s so wary , and especially since there is not often people at home during the day . you have to have good people skills to do that job , though . so , you at least probably have that going for you ."
is he going out drinking ?
well i am not a religious person but i will have to say it urks me when i am surronded my religious people that is trying to push their belief on me . then seeing them feel people heads with stuff that they can not prove is there irritates me also
"oh , thats not unusual . you must try to relax . is it an important presentation ?"
that is a scary situation . people do not care anymore .
"that is awesome , what degree are you working towards ?"
that is kind of odd . i probably would have tried to take a swing just out of pure instinct . what was the reason they wanted to wake you up ?
ouch ! what did you take ?
congrats ! thats so exciting do you fel ok ?
"i still think it is , i always get so excited"
oh wow that is weird . did you say anything to him ?
were you able to take the plate id ?
oh nice . what kind of candy was it ?
glad to hear it . i hate hearing about children having tragic childhoods and not being able to just simply be a kid . but at least she ll have a good perspective and appreciate life more .
what had he made in the world ?
i am really sorry to hear that . i hope everything is alright .
that is a great way to look at it
are you fine now ?
"that is funny , hope he did not give you a heart attack ."
wow ! that sounds amazing . where are you going ?
"thats horrible , hope he is ok ."
"hi , how are you ?"
my last vacation went horribly wrongq !
im sorry to hear that . i have never had a dog . what was your experience of the dog ?
hello how are you and what is your story chat about today ?
"hi , a few months ago , my mother found some stray dogs that were starving , so she told us about them . of course , we brought the poor babies to our house , a mother dog and her two puppies . my heart went out to them , as their ribs were showing , but they were still so loving and sweet ."
that is really nice to see . . . i bet it made you feel good ! so sweet .
"thats sweet that you remember that , how old were you ?"
that is wonderful . how long have you guys been dating ?
congratualtions . what do you do ?
how big was the deck ?
what is scary about what she is doing ? i am not quite understanding what you mean .
thats great . did you create the script ?
thats wonderful news ! its such a nasty disease ! how long has he been clear ?
have you tried to call her ?
what birthstone is it .
i love to play madden .
where is she ?
thats great .
did you stay and ride it out ? i bet it was quite a thing to see !
that must be so much fun . i have never surfed but love to be on a boat .
"wow , children my first is on the way and i am freaking out . you must have great friends ."
thank you . that is our next step we are moving from nyc to miami after the baby . how can we find friends like yours ?
"that sounds fun , i was never any good at painting"
i wish i had a rubber bumper to ram those people with !
"nice , congratulations . how are you liking the new job itself ?"
"thats sad , hopefully the new cat got to live a long and full life with you"
i can imagine ! that extra set of hands and a person you can trust that is the best !
an hour ? damn for somewhere as meh as denny s that really is not worth it .
oh really ? what happened that made you look bad ?
that is awesome ! my experience was quite opposite as i sat waiting in the dentist chair for a hour procedure !
"yeah , that is pretty annoying to have happen ."
"it sounds like you are happy for her , which is commendable given you did not get hired . were you very disappointed ?"
i am so sorry about that . it sounds like you are doing your best to be supportive .
"i am very nostalgic too , that must be a fun time !"
i am sure it did ! it is not easy to have to adapt to another person s habits .
i believe you are really sad although it is a fact of life
maybe she did and remembered last minute . you should ask her !
"is he a stay at home father , or does he just not want to work ?"
"must of been pretty surprised , also great to have friends like that ."
that is a great news . you surely have done a great job .
"no i have n t actually , i recently just canceled my netflix service ! i have been thinking about resubscribing though ."
was the color of red that different to show on the red carpet ?
"argh ! that is tough ! have you been able to come from a place of authentic apology ? it can be easy to be defensive in those situations , which of course only makes it worse !"
you should not be so insecure like that .
"yes , several times . the place is magical ."
why . did you started dating recently or something
really ? ? are you famous then ? what is your name ?
"not the tacos ! ! ! ! seriously , i can understand how frustrating that is . especially when you have the taste for something . . . . . then gone !"
even worse . i am so sorry . what did you do instead ?
laughing and crying for you ! next time !
i have not ! i used to run a lot for soccer practices . have you ?
hahaha thats funny why are you still afraid of the dark ?
that is probably the best thing to do before you go to work for a place . were you happy with your results ?
i feel the same way when i am away from my cat . does he have to travel a lot for work ?
that is good . where you running late
"i do not think you should feel bad , you did not know !"
i am sure he will be okay . maybe you can make it up to him .
aw . children will make us do things we never thought we would or could do !
oh that is so sweet . my grandmother is a great person too and i am glad to know her .
"yes , i love to visit the zoo !"
that is wonderful ! . it is always nice to have at least one good parent .
that is bad . are you still afraid a lot ?
wow that is very sad ! i am really sorry !
"yes i do actually , i was almost in an accident because of rain at night once ."
oh that was so nice of them ! i bet you were relieved !
okay that is good to know . hopefully you pass the test and i hope you studied .

"that must have been a great reunion ! who was happier , him or you ?"

thats awesome . i wish i could go . where are you going ?
"aww man , i hope you brought your raincoat ."

that is good that you found happiness . that is what were all in the pursuit of right ?
that is great that you can trust her . how old ?
what did you almost buy ?
it is hard to find good quality at walmart
i would try target . good quality stuff there .
finding a buyer can be tough . you have a good agent ?
"does it have a good location ? you know the only rule of real estate , right ? location , location , location ."
sounds good . definitely should target a family buyer then
thats never good when you have a bad manager . what made them so bad ?
oh no ! what is wrong with your dad ?
"aw , i am so sorry to hear that . it is not easy to watch our parents age ."
that must have made you feel terrible . were you able to find the dog ?
does not he understand that people have to go to work in the morning ?
what is causing you to question whether it is the right thing for you or not ?
"lol that remind me of a movie i saw with robert deniro , thats absolutly bizzare by the way but cool at the same time"
aww thats too bad that no one else could go . what concert was it ?
"sometimes that depends on the industry . if she works in ones that have high turnover it is not a big of a deal as , say , an administrative job"
"ooo i love doing that , but not so much the upheaval in the midst of it . what room are you going to be working on ?"
that is awesome ! i wish i could wake up that way every morning . did something specific make you feel that way ?
i have done that before . . . i enjoyed it too ! i love looking back at old pictures and stuff
i love cheese too ! what kind of cheese was it ?
"aww poor baby , hopefully shes doing fine now ."
"ha , i used to do that too . but i was almost always disappointed by the toy once i actually got it ."
did they tell you when you may hear back from them ?
arghhhhhhhhh ! i soooo feel for you and have been there . have y all had the chance to talk about it ? or do you even want to ?
are you sure they didnt bring the wrong bill ?
"ohh , i feel sorry for you"
"yes , i feel you . cleaning sucks , but after all that hard work , the results are amazing !"
that sounds very exciting ! what kind of planning did you put into such an achievement ?
are there any other family members out there that could help her ?
that is great ! i am happy for you !
"i honestly have never gone to jury duty , but im sure it was still a pain to put it on your schedule"
"i am so sorry to hear that . i have been devastated by the loss of pets in the past , so i can understand what you are going through . i am sure she was very loved and had a great life with you and your family ."
oh no ! that sounds so scary . was everything ok ?
i am so sorry to hear that ! hopefully he or she was not in too much pain at the end .
"oh man , that is gross ! at least it was vomit and not something else ."
"aw , i am so sorry . how long did you have your dog for ?"
they say dogs are mans best friend .
what kind of dog was he ?
"oh no . that is terrible . i lost my dad five years ago , i know how terrible that feels ."
surprise gifts are always fun .
"oh man , i can relate , that feeling of anxiety before you get there really turns around when you get caught up in the moment"
that sounds prettty bad !
i can not imagine if something like that happens to me . i would be trying very hard to find it .
i agree completely it is an embarrassment to the parents you would think .
what store were you at ?
"aw man , i am sorry to hear that . is there anything i can do to make you feel better ?"
ice cream cake is my favorite ! i am glad you are feeling better haha . you have a really nice co worker .
"oh , i know how that goes . my husband loves sweets , but if it is just sitting there and no one is eating it it will get eaten right then . getting another would depend on how much he likes sweets and needs them . lol"
oh i hate when that happens . we go to self checkout to avoid things like slow lines .
"oh man , that must have hurt . did she know you had feelings for her ?"
wow ! what a nice friend . i wish my friends did that
that must of been a proud moment for you as a father . she s all grown up and out in the real world now
wow ! what are you gon na do with the winnings ?
oh my gosh ! thats funny . was that the only thing that made you think it was haunted ?
roller coasters are scary for me . how was it for you ?
i am so sorry to hear that . i am sure she was very happy while she was alive with you guys .
"that sounds painful , i hope you were okay after your fall ."
oh boy ! that is always a nail biter waiting to hear back and it seems like they love to take the full amount of time before they let you know . did you get it ? ! !
i remember those times . did you get what you wanted ?
oh no ! i am so sorry ! i would feel the same way but you just have to think . . . who cares what others think ! if they can not have compassion for an accident then something is wrong with them . did you get hurt ?
how d the hurricane go ?
was he okay ?
well maybe if you do it a little more then he will be fine with it . i would be afraid just because he is afraid .
maybe so . it is good he has a good home now .
that is a great idea
that is amazing ! you must be so proud .
that was very sweet they do not have to actually do that .
that is awesome ! who were they from ?
you can never be too prepared ! i am sure you have got everything .
we all do things we regret when drinking
you definitely took a leap of faith there . how d it go ?
i wish you luck
that is disappointing . what happened ? did he just not do anything ?
oh no that is a total bummer . it is especially common in the summer months .
cool . was it interesting ?
are you happy or sad ?
oh cool that is great ! what were you doing that they recognised ?
wow was it a scam or was it legit ?
"oh no , what happened ?"
that is great . are you excited ?

"hm , that sounds interesting . i am not really familiar with this kind of situation , since i have never had to rent a car . what exactly happened , or what did that mean ?"
i bet that was a nice feeling
the dentist makes me a bit nervous
"that is awful , did the person who hit it leave a note or a call back number ?"
what kind of food was there ?
oh man . that would of startled me too . what did you do after ?
oh that is tough . it is hard when our pets pass away .
that is great ! i never really studied much so i could have done better on my tests
"judging by the , i am assuming you did not get to join them ?"
i would be envious too . perhaps next time you can go somewhere and return the feeling d
that is nice . do you like a lot pizza ?
were you worried about something ? what was keeping you up ?
dang really ! sounds like you have a boyfriend that likes to shower you with presents .
i have never tried a cold shower ? what is it like ?
wow that is very rude of her
i totally agree . that actually sounds really good rihgt now .
i will be expecting to see you there .
interesting . what was the first thought that popped into your head when you witnessed this ?
how did it go ? that is an anxiety inducing but hopeful situation !
congratulations ! enjoy the new gig ! good things happen to good people .
"being defeatist is never a good move . honestly , once you ve got your foot in the door i think it is all about personality ."
time does fly really fast . i just turned and it feels like i was just a teenager yesterday !
"yeah , it is like a small world ."
indeed they can . is there any specific moment that you would like to talk about ?
i completely agree . we must have positive thoughts at all times .
that is awesome ! what do they do ?
that sucks . how fast were you driving ?
"oh man , i am so sorry to hear that . you are not a loser though ! just take one day at a time . if you relapsed yesterday just move on and do your best not to drink today and tomorrow"
that is probably so annoying
"wow . that is either really lucky or unlucky , depending on what you want . are you wanting kids ?"
why not ?
i have considered it myself but feel the same as you . will you go back again ?
is she doing okay now ?
what is the job ?
what caused that to happen ?
what were the photos of ?
"i am sorry to hear that , what happened ?"
why is that ?
sometimes we believe is the things that happen to us . . . they are many
i interpret the difficulties
the lack of humor
"oh goodness , i am so sorry to hear that . was it sudden ?"
what kind of stuff is in there ?
that sounds so fun !
that is great ! i am glad to hear that . we often take our health for granted .
uh oh what happened
"oh no , well mistakes do happen , it will be behind you in a few days"

i am bad at every game .
"do what i did , quit the job and live at home with mom ."
"that is awful ! luckily i paid all mine off , but i know many people still struggle with it"

i am so sorry to hear that . do you have things of hers that remind you of her often ?
"i have been to that , it is such a wonderful experience . you are going to love it !"
i am sorry to hear about that . how did he die ?
how did you hurt your back ?
did you ask him to replace it ?
that is nice . how do you like the dog ?
"that is for sure , especially a smell that just throws you back"
that stinks . im sorry to hear that
congratulations . fun plans ?
awww . did you keep it ?
that is great . i hope you do well !
how old was it
how d that go ?
that stinks . maybe he is going through something that only new stuff can solve
did you make special arrangements so things went smoothly with one car ?
what did you find ? !
"remind me , which show was that ?"
that is nice . are you going to hang it up ?
i am sorry . how long had you been together ?
that sounds scary . are you going to investigate ?
i am so sorry to hear that . is he planning to retake the test ?
that is great . is that your only son ?
oh wow ! hopefully no one saw it
what is it called ?
that is understandable . how receptive was he to your complaint ?
did you find anything ?
that is a hard hit to take . why do you suspect they got it ?
what did you mess up ?
i am sure you will be fine . have you made many similar mistakes in the past ?
"wow , that is nice . i hope you treated yourself to something extravagant !"
"i guess they did not do as good a job as they should have , lol . wish my car dealership had missed a few hundred bucks !"
how fun ! in a tent or an rv ?
"ugh , that is so annoying . how long did you have to follow behind them ?"
memory lane right there ! which cartoons ?
that would creep me out too what kind of calls ? ?
uh oh . are you going to confront him about it ?
"congratulations , that is awesome ! i hope you are getting a raise too !"
that sounds amazing ! when will you find out ?
"omg , that is so scary ! are you okay ? did you call the police ?"
i bet . it is nice to have a day off every now and then
that is the worst . is it damaging the curtains too much ?
"that is great ! adopt , do not shop ! always a great motto !"
have you prepared enough for it ?
that is good to hear ! have you been eating healthy ?
"thats strange , my dog will eat anything lol"
about what ? !
thats always a bummer when you put in such work and get nothing in return
did you study for it or are you winging it ?
maybe you should try and have a party ?
what will your new age be ?
i went through a similar thing a few years back . everything seemed hollow to me . how long has it been ?
why is it that you are in trouble ?
i would be reporting that to the police for sure .
oh no ! i am so sorry to hear that . that must be very difficult for you and your family .
that is great . what will you be doing at your new job ?
"aw man , that sucks . promotions usually are not given fairly in my experience . was that the case for you too ?"
that is amazingly lucky ! good for you !
awh poor baby . . i am sure itll get better now tho ! how old is he ?
i would be so excited ! did they pay you for it ?
"that sounds like such a fun , peaceful morning . so jealous you have a pool , it is been scorching outside !"
"aw , well when your younger you do not do those things on purpose . i think everyone is mean to their siblings every now and then ."
i am so sorry to hear about your loss . what did he get you ?
well better to be sooner than later on something like that . dont be hard on yourself .
wow ! he sounds like a super smart cat ! how did you get him out of there ?
"oh man , i have definitely had a few coworkers like that myself before . what does she even talk about ?"
did it feel good to get it out ?
"that is heartbreaking , but you are amazing for doing that . cats are my favorite and i have rescued many animals . it is a lot of work ."
i am there too . struggling each day . it really gets old .
you would be so suprised at how much stays all the way in the nooks and crannies of your brain when you take a break !
"oh no , i am so sorry . what did you do ?"
"good , how long has it been since you saw them last ?"
"oh yes , fall is definitely my favorite season as well ! i love fall scents !"
"oh man , those things are awful and reproduce like crazy . we left our house for a week and came back to tons of them everywhere ! the best trick is putting a little apple cider vinegar in a jar , a drop of dish soap on top of that and cover it with cling wrap and put holes in it . they will gravitate toward it and you will catch a bunch ! just keep changing it every few days ."
that is so exciting ! it can be stressful and expensive planning a wedding .
oh that was nice of them
"oh no , i am sorry to hear that . i hope that he gets to feeling better . how old is he ?"
that is awesome ! i would be really excited if i were in yyour shoes !
that is quite upsetting . do you know what ails it ?
"oh no , what happened ? hopefully the whole weekend did not get ruined !"
wow thats nice . what do you drive ?
you have to think of the positives . just because they have a new car doesnt mean their life is great . they could be watching you wishing they were fit and healthy like you are .
"lol and some day you might you buy your own new tesla , if you feel like it !"
oh thats nice
why s that ?
"nice , what do you have planned ?"
wow ! that must feel great ! you should be proud of this accomplishment . people can go their whole lives without ever being published !
what are some things you will bring ?
what is wrong ? are you okay ?
we have been getting a lot of rain as well . i have to mow my lawn so much .
"oh my goodness , i have almost gotten hit while on a bike before and it is terrifying . i am so glad you are alright !"
"wow , congratulations ! have you guys set a date yet ?"
i know exactly how that happens . sometimes the food is just too good to pass up .
glad to hear you are having a good day . wish every day was like that .
that is really awesome ! that is so important to be involved in his life like that .
"that is frustrating , especially if the weather isnt ideal"
that is not good . are you mad at your friend ?
i feel the same way as well ! i get really excited thinking about decorating and giving gifts !
that is a great outlook i think . we often lose focus of that very important fact .
miles ! ? that is very impressive . i bet i could barely make it a mile !
"i can relate to that ! yeah , my wife with my credit card , lol !"
"that is something that takes a lot of contemplation , because it is such a big decision to make . will the extra money be worth the extra work ?"
"oh wow , an additional k is a lot ! i would be willing to put up with quite a bit for a pay increase that large ."
"oh wow , i think it d take me much longer to not bust my butt ! that is impressive !"
awesome ! what kind ?
"that is good on his part , how do you feel about it ?"
oh that is no good . any special reason why they were late ?
"it will be okay . it is always hard making that step , but it is good for your health to do it ."
have you studied for it ? always helps to prepare !
hey everyone trips up a little . what you need to remember is that you and your wife made a commitment and you should follow through on that .
you only get to do it once ?
congrats !
"that has happened to me , but with texts though lol"
did you apologize ?
what is wrong with it ?
that is great news . have you also been working out ?
did they notice it was missing ?
ohh wow ! are you excited ?
"that is very creepy , did he say anything to you ?"
ouch ! did she hurt it or is it a degenerative thing ? i hope she can find help with physical therapy .
"i have never understood that , it is not like they can not afford to eat since they have a job ! do you know which coworker it was ?"
what did you do ?
how do you know no one goes in if you arent in there ?
"oh no ! that stinks . i have never had a cat specifically because i have never been good with the idea of being able to train them . plus it seems like you just get the one personality , and they never grow to like you . but i am biased ."
wow good for you ! i hope that it works out for you !
"what ! first of all , are you alright ?"
that is great . do they know ?
i have never run a marathon
you can try your best and if you do not finish there is always the next one
congratulations ! what are you getting your phd in ?
have you tried to talk to your teacher ?
that is pretty cool that you are motivated and excited to start it . most people would be scared and procrastinating . you will do great .
i can understand that .
"aw , it takes time ! making friends is not always so easy so give it a little bit of time"
"that is really nice of you to do , not a lot of people help others like that anymore"
"ah dang . . . sorry that happened to you . it stinks too because a lot of the time that stuff is just decided by who is liked more , or who has better connections , and not actual merit . if you are good , i am sure you will get recognized at some point ."
thats very sad to hear im sorry that happened to you
did she say thank you ?
that is the worst ! what did you do ?
"yeah , those were better times . brings back good memories ."
oh man . . i have had those too . . and where i am the one getting crap even though i do my job and everyone elses . . i hate sitting around at work . . . i either want to work or go home . i hope your boss knows your co worker is lazy ?
"sounds like you ate a delicious dessert , what did you eat ?"
o ? that is a brave and noble decision .
where will you be shopping ?
hahah it whas happened to me it the worst thing
that is nice of them ! people stopped doing that for me once i got older . i miss them
thats horrible ! im so sorry to hear that . why would she do that ?
o yea ? i
i have cheated on occasion . it is never right but it is easy . at least you are ashamed of it .
that sounds fun . is it a special occasion ?
you must be loving it
tough week ahead . do you think you have met your expectations thus far ?
oh no ! that has so happened to me before ! it was only by a couple dollars a month but i so needed those couple of dollars at the time . i would be maaaddd
i buy those like twice a year and never win .
wow ! that is awesome ! what did you do with it ?
"hey , why not ? it is unexpected money !"
where was she ?
does she have a new ex now ?
i would not put up with it either
i bet you are . what are you going to do ?
why is that
what have you done this year if you dont mind me asking ?
i love it when it is nice out . are you going to do something outside ?
are you excited for him or jealous ? lol
can you report the caller ?
what class is it for ?
that is great . have they always been as supportive as they are now
have you thought about spraying your garden ?
"same here , i am in texas . where are you located"
were you able to get inside fast ?
how did they get off work midweek ?
where is your favorite place to go ?
"i remember when my first child started , i was a nervous wreck ."
have you tried getting out and meeting new people ?
that would hurt my feelings . are you alright ?
that sucks ! did you have a spare on you ?
that is understandable . what kind of project was it ? were you involved ?
"that is okay , i am and still in college . how did it go for you ?"
oh wow . i would have been so scared . more of a stranger than the storm
did the ads bring up good memories i hope ?
sounds frightening ! was this off the coast of a beach or something ?
that is one of my greatest fears . did you have to swim sideways from the current to escape ?
"well , i can understand that . it is very hard to be on a very strict diet , without a break here and now !"
is this a career change ?
"aw , that sucks . did you give her a proper burial ?"
"yea , a new job is useless pretty stressful ."
oh that is a real bummer . were you hurt ?
sorry to hear that
well that is good . you never know what to say in that situation
that must of been fun to go through .
what was ?
really ? did you manage to cope ?
and was there ?
im sorry to hear that
"really , how did they do it ?"
"well done , at least you will sit in your room excited and relaxed now"
that sounds unfortunate . you must have been so annoyed with him !
do you have daughters of your own ?
yea traffic sucks
same here . it reminds me of my childhood for some reason .
i bet ! did it turn out nice ?
that is terrible ! did the dog survive ?
"what i do is to write all the good things i did within the week , i think you should do the same"
you must have prepared really well . did the trip go well ?
all the time
"nice , what breed is the puppy ?"
i do that all the time . i live on the mexican border . what border did you cross ?
cool ! how did it go ?
he sounds pretty strong . any reason in particular that he did that ?
that must be so exciting !
oh how does it go
well that is great and sad all at the same time . how far away did she move ?
"oh my goodness , that sounds terrifying ."
i bet that was quite the blast from the past
"oh , are you going on a trip ?"
that is so nice of them !
really ?
oh no ! i am so sorry ! it is so difficult to lose a pet .
that is awesome ! happy belated birthday ! what did she get you ?
did it rain a lot ?
that sounds like fun ! what happened ?
that seems like it would be a little awkward to me . .
that is always a nice find .
that is nice . did you start playing guitar with him ?
i am also working from home from time to time . i could feel some time lonely .
"oh , that must have been so embarrassing ."
congratulations ! that is so cool !
i can not believe your coworker would do that to you ! did your manager listen ?
oh wow ! i bet you all had a blast ! !
"oh god , what do you do at that time"
oh wow ! are the babies ok ?
oh man . what a bummer ! i love cucumbers and hummus ! do you have anything else you are growing that survived ?
oh what a mess . i would hope that they picked it up .
could you tell me what you have done ?
that is great news ! congrats ! my garden is not doing great this year . do you grow anything else ?
"that is awesome , it is very hot where i live , so i am jealous !"
where exactly are you cos it rained all through in my area ?
ohh wow ! that is not cool
oh man ! hopefully nothing broke !
he accused me of stealing from him
yea i hear ya . im stuck here at work for another day too .
what is the test on ? have you prepared for it ? i bet you will do better than you think !
i feel the same one and lately it seems to be getting worse . i have never been brave enough to go eat alone .
me too ! i am stuck inside at work and hearing about how great it is out there .
"that is not good , what happened"
how did they do that ?
"that is nasty , how do they get away with that ?"
how so ?
sorry to hear that . it would really upset me to be in that situation !
"i am sorry for your loss , at least you got some time together"
i think lyft is better
where to ?
they sounds very complicated
having friends over is always nice !
how do you feel about that ?
did it bring back a lot of old mermories ?
"she is a crappy person , flirting with someone who is in a relationship . good on you stand up guy"
that must of been weird . who was it ?
thats awesome
that is good ! i guess you studied a lot ?
"ouch , that sounds pretty gross !"
i hope it was maybe the weight of the muscle that the scale was picking up .
i do not know whether that is a good or bad thing . which is it ?
what was it i wonder ?
"i like that philosophy . here lately , has it been easier or harder to stay positive ?"
"wow , its good to warm"
what exactly did he do
wow ! i bet you two are very excited !
you sound very confident . that is good
is he being too noisy ?
you were not excited about it ?
ive always wanted to have the eye surgery . im ready to get rid of my glasses and contacts
it is good to believe in good things .
it is true there is nothing like the good old days
i know how you feel . do you have a big trip planned once you receive your passport ?
i hear you . i had the same experience after just years
what subject are you trying to pass ?
why were you acting like that ?
did they say or do anything specifically to you that made you feel that way ?
oh wow ! years at your job ! you must be well liked there .
"oh my goodness , what was the terrible news ?"
"dang , that is not good . what did you end up doing ? ?"
yeah ? what is changing ?
brilliant . here are you going ?
that is so generous of you . the world could use more people like you .
"oh my , how did she react ?"
it certainly can . what type of job are you looking for ?
maybe they had lots of other candidates to see
yes ! i feel like the day escaped me . have you done that recently ?
"ugh i can imagine . but your time will come , be patient !"
oh no ! did you get the surgery ?
are you pregnant ?
good job ! do you feel proud of yourself ?
what did you do ?
i hope it goes well for her
awesome ! glad that you did well on the exam !
oh wow . that is some scary stuff ! ! what happend ?
you should n t like to your mom . i think you should tell her the truth about what really happened .
oh no ! you have to have a tough mentality when you do that as it can be rough to have people see you fail
that is terrible . did you let others know that you had completed the job ?
what kind of surgery was it ?
oh no ! did you scold him ?
congrats to you ! what kind of nurse are you looking to be ?
"that is awesome , what is his secret ?"
im sorry to hear that . does she have a job now ?

you got this just be yourself and professional obviously and do not over think it .
it sounds like you are a great parent . does she appreciate all the help you give ?
im sorry about that . how did you find out ?
whoa that is really cool . did you train him to do that ?
"i understand ! as we get older , it is hard to do it all everyday !"
"oh no , are you able to afford the repair for it ?"
i hope you can too . how is it going ?
that is really good ! do you think you are ever going to use the card again ?
that would have really scared me .
all of it ? ? ? oh no . how bad do you feel right now ?
ewww .
you are having trouble with family ?
awesome ! what are you going to see ?
oh no ! how d you do that ?
did you catch anything ?

that is good to feel that way . you do not want to feel like someone close to you would let you down . did it work out for you ?
"oh gosh , you also scared of bugs ? ? that is my worst fear"
i have no idea what those are !
what are pierogies ? a type of food ?
"that is no good , did you throw it out ?"
"oh , i am so sorry . it has to be the most difficult thing to have to do . i had to do that with my gorgeous lab i still miss him !"
indeed they are . and so are many cats the farm i used to live on has a ginger tom . he s quite the character and used to visit me regularly !
this fella is called oliver . he s a big old softie who is ace at catching gophers . he would bring half eaten ones to my door !
did you get a promotion ?
oh no ! what has you scared ?
oh dang thats so horrible
"i remember that store ! i loved going shopping there , was it your first job ?"
are you having any specific problem areas ?
"interesting , those things are huge , do they even make them any more ?"
"do you have a large family , or do you just like the idea of a large suv ?"
it is a big change . what is scaring you ?
is it really far ?
"well , that would be terrifying ! were you afraid that a vampire was there ?"
you were ready ? that is good to hear .
are you prepared ?
"where you supposed to be there ? if so , then that is a nice feeling ."
that is great . what classes are you taking ?
that is pretty cool . . . are you going to go towards hardware or stick with programming ?
you should go all out and get a ee degree to go with it . you can do microprocessor design .
did that happen tonight ?
did she have a party ?
does she have her license yet ?
"well , there is no hurry in driving , is there ? what does she do mostly on her phone ? text ? ?"
"that is super frustrating ! i have only ever had outside pets so i can not really offer advice , but it is one of those things where your anger is all misplaced because you know you can not really be upset with the dog since it does not know any better ."
you got a present ? how lovely ! what was the occasion ?
i agree . . did something happen ?
that was nice
"so , i take you left to live someplace else ?"
"very nice , congrats on making it that far . i actually was in the same situation about a week ago . how do you feel you match up to the others ?"
"that is great , it is good to see people finish what they start . you must be very proud ."
i am so glad to hear that . did he find a job ?
oh that is wonderful ! how long have you two been dating ?
sometimes deaths affect us even when we re not really close .
is he sick or just being lazy ?
"oh , well that is awful on a little person ! i never liked it when a teacher did that when a child needed to go to the bathroom !"
is your patient improving an following good medical advice ?
thats . . . uh . . . strange ?
"pets are great , but they can be a bit needy for attention at times . it is great , but not when you are busy and trying to get things done ."
oh my god ! that is terrible !
that is amazing ! congratulations ! swimming can be tough
oh man ! i hope no one noticed .
"oh , i bet you are really torn ."
that is one of the hardest parts of life . what happened ? ?
"that is great of them , did you do anything to pay them back ?"
aw poor mouse . i have had a few before . . we actually rescued a few from our cat
what happened to them ?
that sounds like fun . for some reason kids really enjoy cooking .
did you study for it at least ?
that is bad . what did you do after that ?

oh i am so sorry . best thing to do is be there for her .
how did she handle it
did it help ?
that was good of you . he did not hurt her did he ?
oh no ! ! ! where did you end up going ?
there are evil people in this world . i was so scared i cried on the way back home .
"children usually do really well , they are versatile ."
are you excited or will it be lonely ?
i bet it was really quiet and lonely . did you find some time for yourself though ?
well that is not good . i am sorry to hear that . do you think maybe you were just too nervous during the test ?
i agree . i dont know why they work in the service industry if they do not like to be nice
"how exciting ! ! ! i bet you are thinking already about how you want to decorate it and fix up the lawn , etc . ."
any experience with what ?
are you trying to save money by not eating out at work ?
oh my ! i bet you was so disgusted that you ran out of there .
whoa ! that is really scary ! i have felt weird sensations like that before .
aw that is nnice of her

that is awesome ! it would be amazing to win a million one day . one can dream .
that is really upsetting !

how did it go
how many days has it been ?
drunk people can get pretty disgusting in general .
i can imagine . what happend that you got your jaw wired ?
nice . always feels good to be at the top knowing nothing can not touch you
i feel like everyone goes through that phase . i know i did too
especially in the south
did you find out the results ?
oh wow and you could not keep your job ? what were you going to school for ?
oh wonderful ! one of the best fields to be in right now
that is awesome . i never even get a second date a husband may not be in the cards lol
"i hate bad traffic , did you get in an accident ?"
i know what you mean
"that is awful . i agree . a professional setting is supposed to be . . . well , professional . what steps are being taken to correct that ?"
"wow , you do really live far from your parents . do you go to college or work ?"
i can see how that would be a downer . will you still get to see them ?
"i would be really annoyed myself , why so many frequent calls ?"
"i know right ! my parents love tennis , so i grw up watching it ."
good for you to have such memorable experience to have and remember of . can you bake now for real ?
oh that sucks . i hate when that happens .
that sounds exhausting ! were you driving for work or just taking a vacation ?
was he alone ?
congrats
probably they noticed some irregular or even fraudulent activities associated with your account
oh that is really gross ! have you talked to her about it ?
cool . did he have gifts ?
like what ? bad or miserable ?
wow . enjoy your own time .
"wao , thats really not cool"
that is sad . but i am sure they stil want to be firends with you too
"that is awesome , i wish i could build my own house ."
did she die recently ?
that can ruin a persons life .
"tell me more , sounds exciting !"
oh no what happened ?
what concert was it ?
that sounds terrible . i hope you are okay now .
that is so messed up !
"oh wow , what kind of dog was it ? i am so sorry that must ve been super hard"
that is wonderful that you are pursuing a degree . what is it in ?
yeah ? which game was it for ?
oh no . what did you do ?
that is great . what made it so special this year ?
i am so happy for you ! congrats !
it sounds like you are talking about two different people there instead of just one person . i am a little confused .
why what happened ? are y all on a trip ?
that sounds very bizarre .
that is so messed up !
"oh my , what did you do , may i ask ?"
"oh no , what happened ?"
dallas is a really fast city .
what are your plans ?
that is terrible . what happened then ?
those are so stressful . just take it step by step and you can get on track .
you must be really excited for it ! do you think its going to be girl or boy ?
do you plan do something this weekend ?
that sounds like fun do you know who haunts it ?
nice ! you must be pretty confident she will say yes .
that sounds terrible . but hopefully it isnt suffering any more .
have you been studying ? that is intimidating but i bet you will do great ! what is the subject ?
that is very bad . did you complaint to the landlord ?
that is awful ! i am always scared that is going to happen to me when it is raining
"really , where was this parade at ? i am in missouri and it was absolutely pouring on friday"
oh no . feeling empathy towards them just shows you are normal . there is a lot of people in your boat
whats preventing you ?
that sounds fun ! what are they exactly ?
how exciting ! she must be thrilled too
that unfortunate . are you feeling a little jealous ?
i hate it when stuff like that happens .
"haha , nooooo . . . do not do that . there are too many of those people in the world as it is ."
that sounds so great . being in nature makes you feel so good .
"that sucks , sorry to hear that . did you get a refund ?"
did it taste good ?
were you suprised that they did this for you ?
wow ! how happy you must be . i be that day brought you lost of excitement .
"oh so sad , what happened to it"
it must must a very much hard time for you and your family
i would be so scared . i think i might have to leave . did the bears bother anyone ?
were you in a tent or a camper ? i hope you kept your food locked up tightly .
"oh , i am so sorry to hear that . i know pets can be like one of the family ."
that is disgusting . what did you do about it ?
that is interesting ! most kids love being home schooled but i guess she missed socializing and interacting with her peers .
wow good job ! so close
maybe you should job a club or a social gatherings group
i agree . you need to socialize a little bit to get out of your lonely slump
aw that is annoying . work always gets in the way of things . did you ever try to go to her ?
did he take care of it for you ?
"that is awesome , what does your hubster do ?"
"hard work pays off in the long run . if your work is truly authentic in its nature , it is definitely going to be recognized and appreciated"
"oh no , do you think she was trying to get back at you for grounding her ?"
whow ! that sounds really disgusting ! what did you do ?
so sorry to hear that . it is truly horrifying and i wish and hope for nobody to be hit with this calamity
"oh no ! ! did anyone notice ? it is normal though , we all do that sometimes"
that is great that he passed though ! are you happy about it ?
that is pretty neat actually . i wish i had kids to bring to stuff like that .
i am really sorry to hear that .
i can not even imagine to be honest .
i have lost grandparents and greatparents but they were all older in age so it was easier to deal with .
that is awesome ! i hope you will get a promotion . what do you do for work ?
you took a risk huh ? i hope he will be a great worker ! that is good you gave him a chance
oh no ! did he say anything about it ?
awesome ! what are you planning on buying ?
oh no that is crazy !
"i hate those things , i try to not eat those at all ."
i really dislike snooty people who are constantly rubbing their amazing life in your face .
i would n t be friends with someone like that . i mean what can you benefit from that friendship ?
i love taylor swift ! she s talented and beautiful !
you have a test coming up ?
that is interesting . what was she doing ?
yeah i bet it is frustrating . the store gets reimbursed for the coupons so they should not nitpick .
too old for what ? what a strange thing to say .
"oh no , he should n t have gambled ."
oh no ! did you property get broken into ? or your neighbor s property ?
inside the restaurant ? what kind of place was this ?
where are you located ?
who did what ?
oh no ! why not ? !
never know who was ?
"oh wow , what happened ?"
that would give me the creeps ! has anyone seen anything there ?
good for you ! there is nothing wrong or uncool about short hair .
"that is awesome , i went to visit my parents and my hometown last month , it is a great feeling . how was the fair ?"
you must have been sad and angry .
that is awesome ! congratulations !
"ouch , hopefully its not by much . i remember when i was in high school i had a similar situation . they are usually pretty lenient on it ."
did you try to get the money from him ? he sounds like a pretty bad person .
oh wow . that is pretty scary . i would be horrified .
"oh no ! that is sad , did he get them all ?"
"wow , so what are you going to do with it ?"
"that is gross , i can not even imagine what that would taste like !"
"omg , thankfully he was not hurt ."
"congrats ! , i am sure you must be very happy !"
thats amazing i cant wait to have my own one day
is there something that is making you nervous about the upcoming week ?
we all do stuff like that . at least you did not lock them inside your car . done that before !
"did you not want to go out , or did you just not like the movie ?"
"great , when will you know your scores ?"
that is a real bummer . do you at least pass the class ?
"oh no , how awful for you ! i hope people helped you to pick them up and did not help themselves ! ."
that is extremely frustrating ! what were they expecting you to do ? it is not your fault your roommate left it trashed .
that is so annoying . they should not call it that if they can not guarantee minutes .
"oh god ! i have n t had a puppy in a long time , but you forget all the things in your house that are not puppy proof . they find ways to make messes in the most creative ways ."
"that is a huge blessing , i do not know about you but my life is pretty much keyed into my phone ."
do they run them all day long or at night ?
i do not blame you because i hate camping .
what happened ?
"oh that sucks , i hope it has healed since then"
how come ? have you had awful weather lately ?
oh ? big decision . i hope you feel good about it !
oh that sucks ! what did your neighbor do to get you angry ?
"thats awesome , i always loved giving gifts more than receiving them"
i hate when i get teachers that are clueless . makes you wonder how they got the job .
that is always a great start to a day .
oh wow . what is the exam on ?
"oh no , what happened ?"
congratulations ! retail really does suck .
"oh , all the time . what album is that for you ?"
that sucks . did she make a lot of money off of it ?
i am sorry to hear that . why was it a bummer ?
that must feel very refreshing . would you say you feel content ?
that is disappointing . i wonder why he s like that .
something good happen to him recently ?
"oh no , that is not good ! he s not the only one that is not great at french . most of my family spoke french as a second language when i was growing up and i still never picked it up !"
that sucks . did anyone get hurt ?
that is nice . why do you say that ?
that is really selfish . have you talked to her about it ?
oh yeah ? why is that ?
are the good memories at least ?
which one ?
that is rough . why can not you help her ?
how long did it take them ?
that was probably a good plan to buy them ahead of time
what was the news ?
why do not you join them ?
that is too bad . what happened ? is everyone ok ?
holy cow . was anything missing ?
oh yeah that must have been a good time
"that is awesome i will never forget the first time me and my wife went on vacation , where do you have planned to go ?"

"oh man ! i have been there , i hope you did not have anything special down there ? ?"
"taht sounds like fun , i wish i had coworkers that nice ahahah . did you enjoy the party ?"
"aww , i am sorry . is he going to be ok ?"

let s hope not ! my prayers are with her .
you are welcome . it is always nerve wrecking when family is sick like that .
"oh man , sounds like most kids . she s gon na hate it at first , but getting to bed early will help with her future ."
"that is so lucky , they must be so happy they bought that ticket"
what kind of test is it
wow i didnt even know they had cruises that go on for that long
"that is really nice of him , how much time will you have to wait ?"
"that is horrible , natural disaster are the worst because you cant do anything against them"
i bet that was a wonderful day
"that is not good , have you expressed your feelings to your boss ?"
"it is a whole new world when that happens , i can totally understand . how d you cope with it ?"
"oh no , that is bad . have you had someone come out and check the hose ?"
what is that ?
wow when the child just asked ? !
omg that is so gross !
oh god . that is kinda gross .
oh dear . how do they let the parents know what is going on ?
"oh wow . terrifying . all i think of is johnny erricson tada , who broke her neck in that situation . did you do it ?"
do you feel ready for it ?
oh how exciting ! did you take any pictures ?
the market can be competitive if the price is right . they ll sell immediatley .
that is good ! that probably means you worked on it until it became something you are proud of .
what did they do to you ?
i totally get that . i am in the same place with my daughter . i home school and she s learning them too . give it time and she ll get it soon . its so much to memorize at once !
do you hike very often ?
"oh , such fun ! do you have all the stamp it up scrapbooking things i hear so much about ? i bet it can be hard to keep it updated ! they grow so fast !"
so sorry to hear of sam s passing .
that is awesome . i am with you on that . tough times might pop up now and then but life really is great . i do not like to take it for granted .
"mmm , now you are making me hungry for cake . what kind of cake was it ?"
"aww , i know that can be hard , but you can not be too hard on yourself . sometimes you do not have a choice ."
what are some of your best traits ?
"oh boy that is great news ! i hope you did not drop a pretty penny on it ! haha , and even if you did , dogs are worth it ."
"i have never been , but it looks like so much fun ."
"oh yeah i am right there with you , i just do not even go out anymore if i can help it ! how old is yours ? mines"
what did you see ? please do not tell me there was a bug in your bread
or maybe she just knows you are a great worker and very responsible ? i hope you will get a raise after completing those tasks
did you call the police ?
that is great ! i am so happy for you !
i hear you ! i drop things all the time . was it one you just bought ?
"oh wow , she s doing great . i know it probably feels a bit bad that she s making so much more than you , but hopefully you can find away to be proud of her ."
that is a good feeling !
are you afraid of the dentist ?
oh nice ! that is super brave of you .
that must have been a nice feeling .
"haha , sounds like my pupper , is she still young ?"
why he is working late ?
aww man that sucks for you
that should be fun . any big planes ?
that is not very considerate of her . was she a bad neighbor while she lived there too ? some people !
oh no ! that is terrible !

that is awful ! i hope that she did not mean too !
"i am so so sorry ! we lost our chihuahua in february , so i completely understand that feeling . was he sick prior to passing away or was it sudden ?"
i am sure she will be smart with it
were they okay ?
at least you are not getting sued
do not worry you will be fine . it is safe .
i can only imagine . at least its nice in the day time though ?
bet that brought back good memories .
whats the competition on ?
i wonder how that was noted on your report .
that is awesome . congratulations . im sure you earned every penny .
oh no ! do you think it is a wild animal ?
its so hard to monitor that stuff now
on no ! that is no good ! is he still a puppy ?
no way ? do you have proof ? that is terrible .
you havent met all three people in the city yet ?
what kind of job was it
is he going to be okay
that is quite an accomplishment . someone like that is really inspiring .
why ? were they not working ?
he should have been honest from the start . it is on him not you .
that is so cool ! do you do a lot of climbing ?
yea funny how that happens
hey congrats ! is it in the same field ?
congratulation . what is he planning to do next ?
that is cool ! maybe you will get along great !
lol why do you have to steer clear ?
that is a bad realization to come to . where did they all go ?
"it can be hard these days , money is tight"
did you get it all straightened out ?
oh wonderful ! i am glad it went so well ! did she already know some friends there or was it a new school for her ?

that sounds like fun ! are you big into biking ?
that is horrible . what can people do to change things ?
oh my gosh ! that is horrible ! i am so sorry to hear that .
that is great . getting good coworkers is so hit or miss sometimes .
that is awful ! what did you do ?
woah that is really bad ! ! is it due to cost cutting ? they let you off .
"oh no , that is the worst ."
that is an amazing accomplishment . what field are you in ?
that is so romantic . they were not for any occasion ?
oh yuck . did you get a chance to return it to the store ?
wow that must have been amazing !
"dang , that sucks . did you ever catch the culprit ?"
oh wow ! my dog jr died of old age too .
i am sorry to hear that . mine died of old age as well last month .
that can be so aggravating . did the company make it up to you for being so late ?
i know the feeling . what team is he rooting for ?
"oh that is good , last time my computer broke was a day before i left the country"
"oh my goodness , is he with the armed forces ?"
"that is horrible , did anyone get hurt ?"
that is scary . what was it ?
sorry to hear that . what happened on the test ?
he must be very smart
oh no . how old are you ?

that is great to hear that some really care and put effort in to their relationships !
lol ! oh geez so many take years to get it ugh ! but at least he finally has ! i hope he is very romantic too !
"not yours ? that is so weird , usually they are on their way out not in ! lol"
"that sounds terrifying ! im glad you have a basement though , it can be so dangerous if you have no underground place to shelter in !"
"oh my goodness , are you alright ? i bet you created a mess !"
that sounds like a great gift . that is going to be a great time .
"i am sorry to hear about that . it sounds like , to me , that he lived a long life with you though , and that you were able to spend a lot of time with him . i am worried for my girlfriend and what she ll do when that happens to her and her dog"
that is so sad . . . did you have a lot of good memories in that house ?
that was really nice of him . i know that she had to be relieved .
how long had you been married ?
i hate to hear that . i hate tickets . there are so many other things i would rather spend my money on .
"cool , what are you getting ?"
neat ! we took our daughter and her cousin camping about weeks ago ! did ya ll build a fire ?
the times as in multiplication ? teaching children is so rewarding .
what grade is she in ?
where did you go ?
awesome news ! what was the response ?
"that is awesome , i bet you were overjoyed with it !"
oh no ! do you have any way of finding out who did it ?
what did you do ?
well atleast you watch them with him ! i dont like them either .
that ll be tough . do you have anything you can do to keep busy ?
spray water over there
could you get with your hr department to see if they can assist ?
"yea , i used to hate it too ."
is it really hard ? or you just have not have that much time to paly
"that is pretty impressive , does he have any training or just all self taught ?"
that is frustrating ! we have a couple down the street that raises hunting dogs . so annoying all day !
well you must be happy about it .
i hope you hear good news .
"it was nice of you to buy him food , but i am thinking he did not pay you back ."
ugh ! i use to have the same problem with my neighbors dog who would poop in my driveway ! at least it was my tires and not my feet that got the unpleasant surprise .
that is great ! you must have been so surprised and pleased to hear from them .
the way you wrote that makes it seem like you are anticipating something bad . . . do you mind if i ask what you are expecting to happen ?
"that is unfortunate , my own mother was ill for several years , she is getting older as well . do you get to see her often ?"
that was great of him !
oh really what was the assignment
what was it like when it showed up on your door ?
im sure they had a good excuse .
oh crap ! how long untill you realized ?
i am sure you will as well . confidence is great !
that is really cool . what kind of car ?
"aww , that is really sweet and sentimental . i like that . can you still read the words on it ?"
"i was going to say , yeah , that is the kind of thing i would love to preserve in a frame or something for my office . how cool !"
that stinks . what did you do ?
and did you find one ?
did it went well ?
you made quick work out of that
oh goodness . that has happened to me before . i could not sleep
oooooooooo nice !

oh . will he be starting elementary school ?
"damn why d you have to tell me that . . . gawd that is freakin sad , jeezus"

that is a big deal . what are you going to do ?
he sounds like a real hero though . i hope he comes home safe soon
are you and your family okay ?
wow ! how kind is that ! their really are kind people left in this world . how did you respond ?
"on no ! did you have to walk , or did you call for service ?"
why did you feel you had to cheat ? i am sure you could have passed if you had studied .
that is so sad ! what on earth happened ?
that is wonderful ! she must be so proud of herself and i know you are proud of her . its great that she likes learning so much .
you are such a good person to do that !
why do you say that
"oh my goodness , what happened ? did they find out you owe money to the local crime families ? those bank employees need to mind their own business , am i right ! ?"
have you asked your friends for family ?
oh yeah ? and what news might that be ?
"oh my goodness , that is terrible !"
uh oh . did something happen ?
do you think you will get the job ?
"oh definitely , youtube is a great platform for these talented people"
do you think there something wrong
me too ! i bought about a thousand dollars worth of tickets last night !
"oh nice , where are you going ?"
why ? what did she do ?
i would be downright furious . start by smacking him across the face randomly at dinner . that should be a good segway into the conversation .
was any of your stuff damaged ?
exciting ! are you moving to a new company ?
oh geez ! what on earth was it !
"no way . what happened ? if honestly , almost all my days are like this . so , worst has become normal for me"
that is awesome ! always good to be content with life .
definately ! i have one daughter and twins on the way . . . i foresee love overload . how many do you have ?
"not really , do you ?"
"oof , sometimes you got ta do what you got ta do i guess"
i can say that i am satisfied with where i am what i do and what its done for me . are you ?
what are you packing extra clothes for ? did you go somewhere did something happen ?
what concert is it ? are you excited to go ?
"wow , that will be a busy house"
"what did you lie about , are you going to tell him ?"
how scary ! i am terrified thinking a tornado could pass by here
"wow , that is very nice of him ! was there a lot of people there ?"
that is a good idea ! it is always smart to be on the safe side .
where are you going on vacation ?
that must of been horrible .
what job is it ?
what branch of the military then ?
oh no that is horrible . have you complained to the electric company ?
that will be no fun .
that sucks ! i hate losing money as well .
i do enjoy the zoo and the animals . i think they could be just as good .
hopefully one day you might decide to choose otherwise or have a child of your own .
i can say that i have mistaken something for what it isnt . but not sure about the ready for anything
what kind of interview ?
how exactly ?
"oh my god , how did you get out of there ?"
that is a great asset to have emotionally i think .
i agree . music used to have soul and good lyrics back in the day .
how did that go ? did it bring back a lot of memories ?
almost sounds like the erratic weather that we have here in georgia . i do not mind the rain as long as i am inside . the sun is beautiful but sometimes it can be brutal when it starts to heat up . do you prefer sunny days ?
i can agree with that . i do feel the effects of age creeping up on me though
it is good to explore your own interests and what makes you grow on your own .
i once volunteered to pick up trash on the side of the road . it is amazing how much people litter
are you in a dangerous place ?
oh no . did it get ruined ?
really ? so sorry for the lose
that is a bummer . it is never fun to not win .
"that is not good , we ended up lucky with who we have"
that is wonderful ! i hope you will get that promotion ! what do you do ?
"i agree , plus i love making snowmen !"
ouch ! did they try to help you back up ?
that sounds really scary ! is your son afraid or is he use to it ?
"that is a lot of extra money to spen , but it is completely understandable it you are that nervous about it . have you ever looked into calming medications , or meditation to help your nerves ?"
wow . that is intense . did your home get any damage ?
that is awesome . happy birthday ! what kind is it ?
sorry to hear about that . are the damages covered by an insurance ?
interesting . . . . did you do it
why do you cheat on him ?
i know how you feel . are you also spoiled by amazone prime ?
"haha , i know . especially when i purchase firearms related things like ammunition . it has to ship ground . week for shipping ? ! ? ! rage ."
"yeah , the us is huge , landmass wise ."
what did your dog do ?
what happened to you ?
oh nice ! i bet you will remember that for a long time
that is terrible ! how does that make you feel ?
that is terrible . how long have you had this pet ?
where are you going ?
i am never ready . which diet are you trying
i think my favorite and easiest would have to be atkins but still alot of prep to get started
my kitties are my family too . animals are the best .
"that sounds interesting . . what was it ? and how did you find out ? and why did he hide it ! if you do not mind me asking , of course . . ."
how is that working out for you
omg i would be upset too . . . how many times have you called them to fix it ?
does it make you feel happy about your life since then ?
that is why i do not watch sports lol we always make fun of our uncle because he talks a lot of smack and die hard redskins fan
oh i know how you feel ! i wish there was some kind of hotline where you could report a license plate to law enforcement so they would get in trouble for being stupid with kids around
oh no ! devastating ! i am so sorry .
that could turn out expensive . did they need a particular brand for a particular reason ?
how did it go ?
"oh no , what happened ?"
so i am guessing she gave you a good surprise ?
that is awesome . i have never won anything in my life . what festival was it ?
wow thats awesome . how did you win them ? i never win anything cool .
that is crazy ! how is he still employed ?
i am glad that you spoke out and shared your feelings . its not healthy to self harm and pent up your feelings .
"gesh , that is frustrating . i had a dog that used to do that too . had to get a trash can with a lid ."
"that is awe inspiring , very patriotic . did you get pictures ?"
"well , that is great . but you probably should study as well . school is very important ."
i bought a lite brite from goodwill about a year ago . it was one of the remakes from recent years but we had fun with it .
that is great ! how long have you two been together ?
oh i ll bet that did not smell pleasant .
moving is the worst . all those boxes . ugh . i hope i dont have to do it for awhile
"that sounds pretty amazing , what convention was it ?"
that is always so much fun . which ones made you feel the most nostalgic ?
oh yea ? and what did they get you ?
oh yes ? what happened ?
that is not much fun . did he get a new one recently ?
"wow , you are smart and kind ! i would n t know where to start re . building a computer . well done !"
what a nice thing to do . you seem to get on very well with your little bro .
do you know it was her for sure ? that is horrible that you cant trust your own sister .
i hear you ! that sounds almost worse then a nightmare as it sounds like it is stuff you miss !
that has got to be one of the best feelings . i love being complimented .
dont put too much weight into those advertisements . sometimes they are just there to get a rise out of you .
thats nice to hear . hopefully it makes you two happy . i would just unpack the necessities first and move from there .
that would be a great feeling . did something happen to make you feel more content ?
"oh nice ! i know that feeling , is it home ? what made you think about going there ?"
yeah it can be akward some times specially if you dont know what to talk about
yeah a little chat to an old friend can not hurt did you enjoy the conversation ?
do you think they deserved it ?
that is wonderful it is good to hear you guys are doing good progress
thats a really good feeling isnt it ? anything in particular ?
im guessing it wasnt your fault ? do you know whos it was ?
did they not ever come ?
that is awesome . what kind of designs are there ?
its always nice getting praise and compliments . i hope everyone was proud of you
like what ?
are you feeling much more motivated now ? what do you want to achieve ?
happy birthday . that was so nice of them . i bet you were surprised . was there cake ?
"i agree , you need money for everything these days and it controls us ."
i hope your work continues on the path you want and expect .
i know how that feels and it can make you sick very fast . do whatever you can to try and get enough sleep .
what happened ?
yeah that is a pretty good mindset to go by .
that is great ! i am also learning to write code .
why is that ?
"uhoh , did you get lost ?"
what was wrong with it
well music does have a really cathartic effect on people .
wow ! that is a horrible prank ! i would be crying ! what did you do when your friend gave it back ?
i am sorry to hear that . do you mind if i ask what happened today to make it so weird ?
thats crazy . and scary . what happened ?
getting paid is always a good thing . were you waiting to get something special ?
"i hate it when that happens ! were they driving fast at the time , it could have been quite dangerous ."
that is awesome . i think it is great that you stepped up to repay your loans !
"that is such a long time to live in loneliness . i suggest you do , dogs are great companions"
"wow , congratulations ! ! are you guys excited ?"

do you know what kind of dog ?
oh no ! i bet she was mad as heck
"gross ! out of all the bugs that i find in my house , those would be the worse ."
oh no ! did he pass ?
that is great . maybe a promotion or a raise in on the horizon ?
nice ! i hope you get this job if you worked hard for it
i am sure its always fun to view the progress of your creations .
oh yea . . whats happened since then
did it feel good to get back out ?
how did you do ?
it is it is something we all have as humans it is not defined by gender show off your emotions proud .
"he should be ashamed for himself , did he say why he did it ?"
have you hugged him recently ?
did something ruin it ?
i can not think of a certain moment that the idea clicked . it seems like i have always known they can .
im sorry but i am laughing . i bet you were so embarrassed .
its nice to have the internet
"sounds very relaxing to me , as long as my allergies do not act up ."
what happened that made you have to do that ?
i enjoy sunny weather too .
"oh no , i am sorry hun . i hope you are at least moving for a good reason like better opportunities ."
i do almost everyday i feel like that is a great mindset to have to make your day successful .
"i agree , do you have a favorite artist ?"
that is good . did you find out the results of the test ?
what does providence mean ?
that is great . does he do photography as a job or a hobby ?
"that sounds wonderful ! i have never been on a cruise , i bet you are excited and ready to go !"

new york is a fun place to visit .
oh no ! was it too short for your liking ?
wow ! well a cheat day here and there might be okay ! haha
i would feel terrible too . where did you move to ?
"that sucks , imagine being in an environment like that all day , i would go crazy"
it is hard to trust a gps . i have heard a lot of stories about people being steered the wrong way . please tell me you did not do it .
"what did he do , how did he react ?"
"why was she upset ? depending on how many people entered , fifth could be really good ."
nice ! i bet you cant wait ! do you anticipate to releax or do things to catch up ?
"dang , and here i thought i was lucky winning a free soft drink in that contest . maybe we have to pool our efforts together and try to win us something big ?"
did you let him ?
"wow , i really like to do that . i hope you will enjoy it . ."
that sounds revolting ! have you said anything to him about it ?
did you ask her to stop it or did you have to move away from her ?
that is so exciting ! have you run a marathon before ?
what a nice surprise ! did something happen or did he miss you ! ?
i am sorry to hear . why is that ?
sounds pretty lonely . did you meet or make some friends while out of town ?
that is horrible ! is she going to try again ?
"wow , thats great . you must be loving it"
nice ! were they scratch offs ?
omg . . . . that had to be so scary .
that really sucks . maybe you should try egging their door ? or just break in and pretend you are bigfoot while they are trying to sleep .
that is some exciting news . do you already know what kind of vehicle you want ?
i am sure you will . good luck for you ! !
do not be . i think you will ace it .
why not block the calls ?
have you spoken to him ?
i love tennis . will you watch the us open ?
so are they telling you good news ?
ooh how nice ! do you have any guesses as to what she may be making you ?
you are so lucky to find someone special online . that can turn out so badly sometimes for some people .
"wow , watching kids grow up is hard . how has she been with the cell phone ?"
that is great parenting ! you have to trust that your children will make the right choices .
"you should go , otherwise the condition could get worse ."
oh my goodness that sounds so bad ! did they charge you for the visit ?
if i had a bag of m m s right now i would eat them for sure !
maybe save the other half for later . lol .
how did she reacted to the admission to self harm ?
is that like a laser tag place ? that sounds like a lot of fun ! what do you think ?
"oh that sounds worrisome , do you think you will pass ?"
that sounds intensive ! how did it go ?
i bet that was so defeating ! i am sorry to hear that . i wish there was better quality control with some of these companies that deal in parts .
did you save it or kill it ?
"ooh , i bet you can not wait to finish !"
how did they go ? did you pass ?
that is very sweet ! i bet it brought up a lot of feelings inside you .
did you get her number ?
that sounds like quite the checklist . i am glad you brought the beer you might need it haha !
holy cow ! did you call him in ?
how come ? and was it a pain to replace it ?
i hope he did a good job !
how come you did not collect them ? i loved them myself .
"nice , was it hard to start ?"
"that is cool . man , those tiny disks were easy to lose . what game ?"
"that sounds horrible , did you wash it or throw it away ?"
"damn , is he ok now ?"
oh no ! was it a fun night ?
"aww , that sounds interesting ! are you in touch with many people from high school ?"
poor thing ! is he felling better now ? i hope he quit that diet .
were you nervous ?

i am sorry to hear that . i hope you do not have to work through the weekend !
i feel that pain . do you not have the motivation or just dont know what to do ?
i get that . well if i could give any advice it would be make sure you have proper form over anything . dont worry about heavy weight if your form is garbage .
how much pain are you on a scale of ?
that was nice of them ! i bet you felt really cool hanging with them . how did it go ?
"why not , have you have many temptations ? i know how difficult it can be at times to eat healthy , i struggle to do it too ."
it is really a good start to recognized that you should talk about it . we all need someone to just listen once in awhile .
i like dominos better
that is thoughtful of her . nice to know that your mom was thinking of you in the middle of the day .
oh no ! you must ve felt ashamed . did you return it ?
did you get wrote up or a lecture when you got their .
"the journey there is always the toughest , its years of practice and studying but in the end it will be totally worth it"
"wow , that was serious then"
wow that sounds scary . did you make good friends ?
"oh , that must have been a hard thing to do . i would hate to be the one to deliver such a bad news . . ."
i bet it does ! do you go by there often ?
oh no can you tell me ? it is okay if it is too private .
oh my gosh i am so sorry that really sucks . can you talk to the professor and try to make it up or find out what you did wrong ?
oh no why would they do such a thing
that is not cool . i bet it felt awkward .
"nice , silence is golden"
"oh no , was it one of those meetings that should have been an email ?"
"oh really , were you supposed to tell them ?"
did you ace your test ?
"nice , what a legend and a gentleman"
"that kind of cold disregard for someone you are supposed to love is totally alien to me , the guilt would destroy me ."
it is awful ! i know so many families are dealing with similar situation . sometimes we do not know how to help someone close to us . heart breaking . . .
did she feel bad and apologize after she realized what you had done ?
"that is inspiring , has that worked for you in the past in the same way ?"
that sounds frightening . did you get home safely ?
"nice , what are some things you realized ?"
"oh god , how did you . have the courage to even go outside ?"
"wow , how could they do that ?"
you should . no matter what you can not lie to your mom . it will always come back on you .
nice ! do you have any superpowers ?
"oh nice , what kind of memories ?"
that is awesome ! you are going to be rolling in the dough with those skills
"an interesting one , what does this make you feel ?"
"that is so kind of you , i also a have a soft heart for animals . i happen to be a dog person , but i do have a cat that was my ex boyfriends ."
where are you going !
"wow , that must ve been disappointing ."
"yeah , it is like time passes but the smells and everything stays the same"
i think i would leave if i saw something like that .
did you tell someone about it so they could take care of it ?
"i feel that way sometimes when i check my bank account , how s school going ?"
and got upset with you ?
"good for you ! i hope it does not stress you out , though ."
"dang , how fast did you run away ?"
"that is awesome , what types of photos did you find ? anything funny or silly ?"
"it is not fair , eh . having to suppress those feelings day in and day out is significantly harder than the mundane work itself . at least it is comforting know that most everyone feels the same ?"
"oh wow , what ovie was it and how did it make you feel ?"
i liked my friend very much and believed that he can not talk negatively about me
"oh no , i am sorry to hear that . how is she doing and how are you holding up ?"
"oh no , maybe buy her a new cake to make it up to her !"
i am so happy for you ! why have you been apart for the past two weeks ?
"oh no what happened , are you alright ?"
that is what i like to hear ! what changes did you make this semester to achieve your possible . ?
it sounds like you are quite the organized person !
that is so exciting ! best of luck to you man ! i doubt she would reject such a great guy like you .
"i would n t worry too much about it . none of it really matters , if we make a difference or not , we all end up dust in the end ."
"yeah , s were incredible , the dancing the cars , the women had style and the music was incredible ."
congratulations on your success ! i bet you worked incredible hard to achieve your goals .
"oh no , can you return it or get a refund ?"
that has got to be rough . at least it has a home now that hopefully has more time .
oh no ! are you the jealous type ?
oh no do you feel ready for it ?
oh that sounds really annoying . maybe you can look it up online or get someone to help ?
"that is great , what has been going on in your life recently ?"
they looked really exciting ! does it make you want to play it again ?
that is always frustrating . what happened ?
what did he do ?
what was it that you accidentally ate ?
i am glad it went as planned . i can imagine that to be a very stressful moment .
i know how hard diets are to stick to . what foods are you avoiding ?
"do not be too hard on yourself , it is hard to quit something immediately . just keep trying , i believe in you !"
why not ? what happens tomorrow ?
that sounds creepy ! is there any chance someone could start escorting you to your car ? there is strength in numbers !
i hope that all goes well . i am sure he will be good as new after !
that is really cool ! i bet people really underestimated that underdog !
he s a brave man . how was the experience ?
congratulations ! worrying about tuition is the absolute worst panic !
did you guys write still write notes in each others books in high school ?
that is awesome ! hopefully it comes back in one piece .
im sure that is tough . you must really miss him .
do you get nervous being on your own ?
oh that sounds even tougher . it is a long time but i hope it flies by for you and your hubby is back home again .
thats horrible ! did you get the police involved ?
yeah i would have felt the same way .
that is a ton of traffic . i hope they finish their project soon
how lovely ! i such it was so nostalgic to talk about old times together .
awe your such a caring and loving person ! are you going to keep it ?
"oh wow , that must ve been a hard situation . especially later when you were more in control again ."
what is happening this weekend ? i hope you have some good things planned .
that is interesting . are you okay ?
why what happened ?
oh no ! i hope she s forgiven you since then .
i am sorry to hear you were upset ! why did you have to quit ?
"hmmn , really ? . . i guess you must have felt very bad"
aww i am sorry that happened . why were you embarrassed ?
it is always difficult when you feel self conscious but i have learned that people rarely judge you as hard as you judge yourself .
in reference to what ?
that is horrible ! i am a parent and i could never take money from my child . did you confront him ?
"that is really nice , however , to keep the marriage fresh and strong , i think it is important for you to have outside friends ."
what did you do ? ? ?
"stay hopeful ! , they ll release it sooner or later"
that is so sweet . it is wonderful to have things that bring back these beautiful memories .
. . . . what feelings ? what are you talking about
"that does not sound very good , but jealousy is a hard thing to deal with"
"oh no ! when that happens you have to get up and yell , safe !"
eh not really . what about you
and what does that mean practically ? what will you do differently ?
oh it is always sad when someone you care about leaves . can you at least keep in contact with him ?
everything is going to be okay . try to relax .
that is great . . may i know what you have learnt
it is challenging i guess . . best wishes that you developed skill over it
how hard have you been studying ? exams are extreme amounts of mental crunch time !
i bet you will do great ! what job is the interview for ?
good for you . being prepared is always better than the alternative .
oh no ! you must feel really bad . are you able to fix the problem ?
why do you need to go to the doctor ?
that sounds very uncomfortable . were you honest with them about your change of plans ?
oh i bet that was amazing ! i have a memory of going to a waterfall with my parents when i was young and it is a nice thing to think back on . does your daughter remember it ?
"i totally understand , i hate carnival rides too , they always feel so rickety . do you have a particular one you fear the most ?"
oh my goodness ! that sounds awful ! was this recently ?
that is so scary ! you must have strong intuition
it was nice of you to at least think of it . i am sure she was not that upset .
"oh , that is not good . did you get a warranty for the phone ?"
"did the other dog provoke him ? i would n t stress it too much , its just natural behavior for them , take him to training school ."
oh i am so sorry but i bet that was very special of you to find .
that is awesome ! congratulations !
that is exciting ! there is nothing like listening to your favorite music with great headphones
"oh thats heartbreaking , do you guys already have children ?"
"young love , it is such a bittersweet quest ."
it is always difficult losing a pet . i am sure you had a flood of positive memories and sadness than they are gone
nice ! why do you like it more than other places you ve lived ?
that is a blessing . i know a lot of people did not have a mom like that .
i am sorry . i know how that feels . did you study really hard ?
that is sweet ! i have a great husband too ! how long have you been married ?
oh gosh ! that sounds frightening ! did you get out the taxi as soon as you could ?
"i usually love the trips down memory lane , but the sad side of it are the ones who are no longer around . i am sorry ."
oh . i know lying is sometimes beneficial in some situations . hopefully you did this to protect someone s feelings
"that would make a funny video ! we have a super friendly , playful cat too ."
"that was thoughtful , sometimes i think kids fake being scared just to not be alone . hope you did not get kicked too much !"
kids are interesting creatures that is for sure . i am sure you got some cool uncle points .
i feel the same way about my dog . they are the greatest !
nice ! what did you have ? i am planning to serve breakfast for dinner tonight .
i hate when that happens . i bet you meant well but you are left looking like a crazy person ! i hope they understood .
what happened ? the yard always has mysteries !
maybe you should find him and apologize right now .
you could just cook him a nice dinner or plan a special date instead .
"i can understand the feeling , i went through a couple of spells like that in the past . i am sure they mean well but you are at a point where you are hurting to get back out there ."
"aww , that is so sad . i am an animal lover so i understand the pain ."
"ah what a responsibly to take on ! you are a great example , is it quite tough ?"
alot easier than a kitten or a puppy then ?
i bet you can see the stars and hear all sorts of wildlife at night .
all that outside noise can become so soothing if you left it .
living out in the woods can really make you put things in perspective too .
did you wait until the last minute to ask for time off ?
oh no ! have you tried taking your dog to the vet ?
well that sounds like a high stress occupation !
i am glad you like it . i think it would be hard to get it right every time the way the market is sometimes .
i wish you the very best with it all !
i do not know what you can do . a duck is just a toy that taste good to a dog .
that would be bad you should double check before you leave
why were you ashamed ? did she disturb the neighbors or something ?
thats awesome ! do yall have any plans ?
yeah we dont thinnk about how special it was until it is gone
have you taken her to the vet ?
that sucks . next time they should tell you instead of laughing !
that is great ! you should celebrate and enjoy this momment
awesome ! what is it about ?
maybe you can save more and be able to get one .
the holidays are a great time for that sort of thing . what did your family do together ?
i hope you can have you applied or did you interview already ?
i am sorry to hear that . hopefully something better is coming along for you soon .
"ah that always sucks , did she need to go out or is she sick or something ?"
"oh no , is it painful and disrupting you in anyway ?"
what did you do ?
it has been raining a lot here too . definitely ruins a weekend planned outside of the house .
so are you making him a gift ?
"do you have a general fear of flying , or is there something about this trip ?"
was it another boring day today ?
i know the feeling . hang in there ! tomorrow is always a new day
"there is very few brands i feel that strongly about . what kind of yogurt is it , i might want to try it ?"
that is horrible . americas government wont be of help . . . . hopefully you have family ?
yes i love animals and have dogs right now .
"that sounds super scary , could he tell that your were scared or nervous ? how did you escape that situation ?"
that sounds a little scary . why was he running towards your car ?
"aww , i am sorry , but i must say pirate peanut butte cookies do sound good , did they help you feel any better ?"
that is amazing . were you impressed ?
"me , too ! i work at the registration department at a college and we re very busy until school starts ."

good for you friend ! i am sure you will find something soon . what field of work do you want to be in ?
"oh no , they went on vacation without you ? ?"
"oh no , i am so sorry to hear that . how are you holding up ?"
"the big one ? the bar ? that is a whole lot of schooling and effort culminating in to one test ! i imagine you are very excited , but anxious too ."
you study hard ?
"oh no , have you talked to him about it ?"
oh i would be pissed . hopefully you had more so you could fix another plate .
"i would imagine so . what a great time of our lives college can be . the world just seems right , being surrounded by your peers , all sharing similar goals ."
"that is great , confidence is always a key in success ! i believe that you will pass as well !"
"aw , that stinks . why could not they come ?"
"oh man , i bet you did . i would have had a gag reflex if i saw some one puking at the bar ."
"me too , it is so hard not knowing what to expect ."
what was the book about ?
"oh , i understand . i also remember mine . do you remember something else about that day ?"
me too ! i love that game !
nice ! how long has it been since you last saw her ?
all spiders or just the poisonous ones ?
"wow , is she an older or younger sibling ?"
"omg ! i hate cockroaches , they are ugly insects"
were you able to kill it ? what did you do ?
wow ! that is really cool . did he land the back flip ?
it happens sometimes . it only becomes a problem if you forget often .
i hate burger king ! mcd s all the way
"that is unfortunate , did you fail the test ?"
wow ! did you tell them anything ?
"oh , snitches are no fun ."
who ?
i know how annoying that can be . i love dogs but they certainly get do annoying things at times .
i have done that before . it is not fun .
"ooh , what kind of trick did she learn ?"
american football or soccer ?
"yeah , that was a surprising result ."

that is good you have someone to share your happiness and problems with
same here ! where do you volunteer at ?
what are those
"that is excellent ! i wish i had the courage to do so , too ."
"oh yeah ? was it because you did not know if you could do the work , or because of all the hot college girls"
that must be nice . i wish i had one .
what about it made you feel nervous ?
"i lost my dog last year , i miss her too ."
that must feel good .
wow thats completely unfair !
"wow , lucky you . i play those once in a year only"

i hate chemistry because i think we should leave all that stuff to nature and just live our lives as the animals we are
wow that is annoying . did you get a spicy packet after ?
did you drink a lot of coffee when you were a child ?
well did you pass or did you fail ?
oh you must love getting cancer results !

oh really ? what were you guys talking about ?
"he must be a good person bit if he s a stranger , is it safe ?"
i am sorry to hear that ! what was its name ?
that is good ! never accept anything less !
"i can imagine how it feel , more so if its someone who never leaves his her phone down ."
"wow , that sounds intense ! i hope you will find out there was nothing to be stressed about after all !"
"that is sounds amazing , you"
i feel you . i am still scared even though i am sort of successful now !
have you always felt that way or have changed your view over time ?
yes i believe in you
i am so sorry .

"oh my god , that sounds like the most terrifying thing ever ! where was this so i know never to go there ?"

"wait , you forgot you are vegetarian ? that must ve been pretty shocking"
who have you helped recently ?
that is really kind of you . does the old man appreciate it ?
sounds like a great friend ! do they just listen or offer helpful advice ?
did your mother find out ?
that sounds unfair . maybe you will get another chance to win .
i am not much of a gamer myself . what is your favourite game ?
i can sympathize with you . i have had a lot of betrayal in the past . the only thing to do is to continue looking for trustworthy individuals .
"oh my god , did it take a lot of work ? and did it annoy you when it fell down ?"
same . i hate my life . i sit in front of my computer all day
why do you do it ?
that is unfortunate . did you make up afterwards ?
"hi , what makes you think that ?"

that is so heartwarmingly sweet . i know exactly how you feel since my family means the world to me as well .
what do you do ?
why do you find it hard to throw away old stuff
"oh no , i have had that happen before , it is the worst . i hope it was not too bad for you !"

"where do you live that there are monkeys in the mountains ? i live in florida , the flatlands . lol"

"wow , thats terrible . did you get him to pay you all back ?"
i am sorry . it sucks when you put time and effort into studying but the grade is bad . could you get help from your teacher or a study buddy ?
"aw , i know that must be hard having to take care of yourself so far from loved ones that you can depend on ."
oh no ! that is horrifying in high school ! i hope you did not get made fun of .
holy crap ! is there not a landlord or something you can complain to ?

oh no ! did you guys stillhave a nice evening ?

i feel exactly the same way . people should be more considerate and be on time for the sake of others .
"i agree , it is something i struggle with as well . have you tried an diets you liked ?"
that is so cool ! did they get you anything nice ?
aw im sorry . are you doing better now ?
that is a good idea . i have n t done that in years . i always feel like i barely dodge a bullet by not getting it .
"i feel you , but at least it should be shorter than driving and the odds of a mishap are much lower than regular transportation ."
that is awesome . i was always a daddy s boy growing up .
"i am sorry your dog passed away , i totally understand wanting to keep a momento to remind you of him . was he old when he passed ?"
aw what a sham ! did they give any reason why they hired from the outside ?
"oh man , that is exciting ! do you know what kind ?"
that is so sweet . what kind of bird is it ?
you are lucky the cow didnt hurt you .
hopefully it will stop soon . that is the worst having to get creative with the little food you have on hand .

"oh no ! i am so sorry about that . do not blame yourself , animals like to play with each other !"
"that sounds great , i can remeber going fishing with my dad at that age . did your year old have a good time ?"
poor doggy ! did you have to take him to the vet ?
thats really nice you have a friend like that . that is hard to come by . i hope everything is better for you now .
i hope you arent and i am not too ! it would be rough living on the streets .
that sounds fun ! where did you go ?
i am so sorry you feel that way . maybe you should talk to someone you trust . a family member or a friend .
what kinds of pets do you have ?
did he have superpowers ?
"oh wow , are you going to be in front of anyone important ?"
"wow , that must be an interesting thing to be involved with . lots of milk too , i presume ."
"awww , i understand . dogs are sooo great to be around and they are super friendly ."
that sounds like such an enjoyable life . if only it was so easy !
oh man heart breaker . thats good yall are friends though . you never know maybe one day yall will be married
"ooh , i have always wanted to learn how to do that . you must be so excited !"
ooo ! that is exciting ! congrats on your baby ! i hope your guests enjoy their time .
usually it will let you know if something is wrong . part of how we are designed !
"oh no , how did you make things right with the manager . i am sure he is just wanting to get paid ."
"that is a tough spot to be in , maybe you could of washed dishes for him . or give him your phone for collateral ."
oh man i want that too ! did you get it ?
do you use your computer ?
how much do they go for ?
"moving , is always such a pain . did it go smoothly at least ?"
"oh man , i can not stand barking dogs . i wish owners would do something to shut them up ."
"aw man , childhood is full of good memories ! i love the smell of strawberries ."
your neighbor does not do anything about his dogs ?
really depends on the person i think . you can not have good people without bad people .
"you are very lucky my friend . there are so many children out there that can not say the same , sadly . but so happy for you !"
what did you end up doing ?
"i have a son , it is definitely nice to have some peace and quiet ."
did you get it ?
"that sounds like a bummer . hopefully , you did not lose too much ."
"hey , that is awesome ! i hope you get it . when do you hear ?"
you must have been relieved you were able to help . did all go as plan ?
"oh , that is terrific ! what a great feeling that is , to be appreciated and valued !"
"i also have two older puppies , training takes time and care and love ."
i remember the lite brite toy . it was a nice toy to have .
"moving can be stressful for sure , hopefully you had some help ?"
that is not good ! what did you do to try to get him to listen again ?
"oh man , i am about to eat dinner over here ! lol that is pretty gross . my cat pukes up stuff all the time so i can kind of relate ."
"interesting , what was the issue ?"
i bet you cant wait . where are going for your vacation ?
that sucks ! what were they upset about ?
that is exciting ! when will she be moving in ?
that sounds very frustrating .
what happened ?
congrats ! how exciting for you .
it always takes time . hang in there it will all work out .
what subject did you choose ?
why was the officer yelling at her ?
that is so wonderful . i love being cared for when i am ill .
"sorry about that , you could have taken a taxi"
did you have a good childhood ? you must miss a lot of things .
"that is unfortunate . but at least you learned from the experience , right ?"
that is nice that you helped him . i am sure he appreciated it !
wow ! were you hurt ? was anyone else hurt ?
"oh that is great , its awesome when the kids go off to school each year ."
"wal mart is a place where weirdness always happens . can you tell me what happened , i am dying to know !"

"wow , how was it ? i have never seen that trailer ."

that sounds like a bit of work . are you adjusting to your place now ?
"oh , i am sorry . why did not you get to go with him ?"
was it a lot of fun ?
"that is great , but you do not have to wear a fancy dress to be beautiful . i am sure you are gorgeous no matter what you wear !"
what a great feeling ! you must love your dog .
are you looking forward to it ?
why is that ?
i can not play those kinds of games . too spooky for me .
"oh my gosh that is insane . well , i am sure you will be able to control your impulses in the future ."
"aww , sounds like he is teaching the puppy . that is so sweet ."
"i do understand , i have a son myself . you just need to be patient and continue trying ."

"it can be nerve wrecking . i am sure you will do fine , though ! have confidence !"

good job ! how do you think you did on it ?
yeah i like going straight to the point too
i understand that completely ! did you have to get any work done ?
oh no ! i hate when that happens . was he afraid or just did not want to sleep ?
"that is wonderful ! you must be happy , shows that he is getting bigger , soon it will be college"
that will be fun . what a great way to relax and unwind
"that must be hard to do , he wants to be beside you . he is going to miss you ."
that is so sweet . what is her name ?
"that is very cute , the little one probably could not hold its bladder as long ."
that is good . how is it going ?
i am glad you did not hit the dog ! did he jump out at you suddenly ?
"lol , guess you were pretty hungry"
that sounds amazing . what is your favorite beach to go to ?
i sure it was beautiful
"yuck , how gross ! !"
"oh my gosh , i am so sorry for your family ."
why do you live so far from family
what ? that scary
i understand ! i live in the country and have the same problem .
that is very cool . what took you all around the world ? what was your favourite place ?
that is so sad . i hate it when pets die .
i am going on a trip to peru to visit machu picchu ! i can not sleep because of the anticipation !
i hear it is a very spiritual place to be and full of beauty and history .
congrats ! did you do it because of football season ?
cool ! whats your favoirite ? i like the office .
same here ! i am glad you are doing well !
a puppy ! that is so exciting ! are you going to keep it ?
"well i am sure he will be , most guys are . i would never get to do anything if my girlfriend did not trust me ."
yes sometimes people do stick their noses in where they do not belong
wow ! how much did he win ?
good choice . you could have broken down and never made it to school .
everyone handles stress differently . my anxiety gets so high i sometimes cancel my plans .
oh no ! it will be ok . it seems everyone in life has to go through that at least once . everyone gets through it !
"i hope everything is fine , how did it turn out ?"
neat . where are you going ?
"oh wow , are you feeling super envious ?"
"i m glad to here it will be fine , but what was wrong with it ?"
"wow , that is so mean of them to laugh at you ! at least someone pointed it out eventually , right ?"
wonderful i bet she is really content if everything is perfect . love to hear that someone is doing well .
the waiting must be very difficult and nerve wracking .
a new haircut can do wonders ! i always feel like a million bucks after .
oh ? what specifically were you talking to her about ?
haha you are a good father . i hope you can make it through it !
oh no ! so what did you do ? !
haha everyone has to do that once . can you tell me a great story about the party ?
"wow , cool . maybe you can ask to tag along ?"
that is amazing ! how old is she ?
i am sorry i do not know what nclex is but i wish you good luck
wow ! did you try to get it out ?
do you feel nice and refreshed though ?
oh no ! did it break ?
did you do some neat doctor stuff on it ?
"that is good , how long did it take before you go him to this point ?"
wow they must be doing well . why dont you try to get one ?
yeah sometimes kids say things that they really dont mean in the heat of the momment
ugh my neighbors do that sometimes . it is the worst ! i think some things should not be allowed to be cooked unless you live alone .
oh that is the worst feeling ! i hate using the restroom in public as is .
"i am with you , i like it a lot more than summer personally"
i was very nervous . i did not know if i would pass or not .
"i am the same way , i barely make anything compared to a lot of people i know"
i am assuming that he she did not return it in time . i am sorry .
that is amazing ! i am really happy for you !
"that does sound terrifying , are you feeling better ?"
"nice , for what position"
"you are much braver than me . i would never host a dinner party . . do not feel like i am good at planning , and do not feel like i am interesting enough to talk to a bunch of different people ."
"aw , that is too bad . you did the right thing by telling her though ."
"i am right there with you ! god is good and wow , he s been with me through so much hardship . i am so happy you feel the same way ."
they really have changed . i know exactly how you feel and love thinking back to the time .
oh fun ! how big was it about ? did it have neat markings on it ?
what is your nieces name ?
it will be amazing ! i should do that too !
that sounds like the perfect remedy for feeling down . getting out in the sun and outside the house bed is so good . i am sorry you are struggling with depression . i understand .
"i imagine , are you prepared for it ?"
"aw , did it bring back a lot of good memories for you ?"
i am sure it ll be ok . usually if you stay in contact with them and do not blow them off for a long time it will be ok .
that is good . i assume you have studied hard and are prepared ?
"haha , i am sorry but i had a little laugh at that . it reminded me of the time i did that to my teacher in school . i was embarrassed , but it made me feel better to find out that it seems like it is a common thing that happens , since they are female authority figures that you can easily mix up ."
"that is gross , why are they coming in ?"
"i sure wish it was not . i live far from my family and they can not even make time for me to go to them . so i feel for you , it is very sad ."
i bet it was not comcast ! they would n t even give you a cup of water for free .
"oh , wow ! that is crazy , have you talked to the vet ?"
well it is a good thing you unplugged everything !
that sounds amazing ! but terrifying too lol
hahah that is funny . were your parents angry ?
"nice , what system do you play on ?"
that is the worst ! have you tried talking to your neighbor ?
thats awesome ! its really cool to be able to keep things in the family
yeah that can be nerve racking ! how did it go ?
good job ! do you feel pretty prepared ?
wowza ! congrats ! is it a job you can build a career out of .
oh thats good ! thanks for teaching .
man . . i need some of that luck !
i agree ! i wish i was able to make things
that is cool ! i love flash backs from the past especially when it comes to television . i sometimes watch old shows on youtube that i used to watch as a kid . love it !
"that must have been embarrassing , i hope you were not to traumatized"
aw man that sucks . it must have been a crazy storm .
you should n t think about death whilst you are alive ! just live each day to the fullest .
that is a good test of friendship . did he keep his word ?
"nice ! i hope you get it , i ll cross my fingers for you also ! do you think you got a good chance ?"
oh cool . were there any good picture in there ?
oh boy . i have gotten quite a few of those before . new hairstylist ?
"ohhhh , disgusting . what did you do ?"
"i bet , what a terrible feeling !"
is there anything that you can do to help prepare yourself ?
"oh my , i hope that does not mean more workload for you ."
"yeah , flying can be scary ."
thats awesome that you trust her
oh no ! thats horrible . were you driving ?
that is the worst ! because now you will be freaking out trying to think of the things you may not even remember whether or not could have been there . that must be an anxious feeling .
"oh man , thats the best feeling in the world . getting out of a shower especially if its into clean freshly laundered sheets ."
how did you you go over your budget ?
awww . that is good news !
oh gosg . do you have some greedy roommates or something ?
yea i have
literally me right now actually
what is going on with your work ?
ouch . why ?
"its not so bad , it can be intimidating but you just need to figure out the campus layout and classes but its very smooth from there"
"you are so right , did you read that somewhere ?"
"yes , i feel that every day ."
why did you throw your laptop ?
"wow thats vivid , what game was this ?"
"oh no , i hope it was not an important meeting ."
i am sorry your wife is sick . what kind of soup is it ?
yeah . reminds me of the good old days !
"yikes , that is a tough one and i can definitely feel your pain on the job market . i think either network your way to a higher pay job depends on connections or possibly go back to school to a doctorate or certain specialist degrees ."
life is the most beautiful thing .
waiting in line is the worst .
sounds like you are pretty confident in yourself !
i do not understand what you are trying to tell me . is this a joke ?
i can imagine the flood of emotions .
sounds like you are prepared . i like the confident attitude . go get them !
i completely understand . maybe you need a vacation to recharge the batteries .
that is not true i am sure . do you have any friends to hang out with ?
ewww that is gross ! did you help clean it up ? and what was in that pizza anyway ? ?
the future certainly can be scary .
"oh wow , the whole cake ? has she found out yet ? was she mad ?"
oh cool . how does it work ?
"oh man , i would be so jealous . when will it be your turn ?"
that is good ! you are awesome ! family is what is important
ready for all those ice breakers ? those amazing crazy party ? what are you hoping to do this year ?
what ? what happend ? why are you angry ?
"i think that is a kind of natural reaction , especially if it is just a hobby . i would have a fear of being judged ."
that does sound like fun ! where do you guys plan on going ?
that is awesome ! it is so good that you have such a positive outlook on everything .
what did he do yolo ?
"oh , yuck ! that is gross . did you get sick too ?"
"do not be ! i know this is overused but trust me , it is not as hard as everyone else makes it to be , if you focus and aim for your goals , you will get it ! i know you can do it !"
"it really is , what can we do to help ?"
what was the project ?
what are you looking forward too ?
yeah . it would be best to check the website for a list of approved items
are you his best man ?
sounds quite interesting to code
what happened ?
that is good ! i hope you had a good time ?
what are you planning on doing with it ?
why do not you go get yourself some food ? or just order some ?
"wow , spooky , what did you do next ?"
you having money problems ?
"oh , that stinks . . . literally ! i have pets too so i know how you feel . my cat will eat too much sometimes and throw up !"
thats good ! nothing wrong with hard work and dedication
"yes , where do you live ?"
"yeah , we have a lot to be thankful for . we take for granted many of the perks of being a us resident !"
that is great . where are you selling your popsicle ?
you were probably just being you .
i understand . is your family living far from new york ?
that is a great mindset to have ! you must feel very happy and content !
oh no . . and no one really likes pumping gas .
did you give it back or just walk away ?
i would ask the realtor on some background and even google the address to see if any abuse headlines come from that place .
i am sorry to hear that . . . sometime you just have stop and take a deep breathe so you do not get overwhelmed .
"maybe it isnt your body , but also your partners ! something to check into to see which end its coming from , but none the less it will happen !"
"thats kind of you , did everything go well when you put it back into the wild ?"
"yes , i hate those kind of people . they have nothing to do expect lying about other people ."
i am sorry to hear that . i hope he is feeling better .
"sounds like something on a movie ! what a work day right , my god . bring extras next time ? lol"
"that is very sad , has he considered getting help for his addiction ?"
has it been a lot of fun ?
"i understand that feeling . it would n t make sense for us all to want to do the same things , especially if you ve partied before already ."
oh that is great ! does it come with a nice raise ?
i am so happy for you ! all of your hard work paid off !
oh my . . . i hope you did not hurt yourself .
"yea , i feel the same way . it is worse when you have to pass by them twice a day ."
"oooh , how exciting ! ! what kind of car did you get ?"
indoors ?
in the th grade ? where is this school ?
makes sense . i live in the states . we have no money for such things .
wow ! ! that is crazy . i am like that though . i never win anything either
"oh god , i am so sorry . is he okay now ?"
do you not fly often ? it isnt too bad .
"you have to be more careful next time , maybe you need a calendar to remind you ."
that is a fantastic feeling . i hope you get it .
"that must have been a bit scary , you should have called the police ."
"okay ! now that is interested , i would love to see them ."
oh really ? i will be checking it out . i would love to have some .
"free ? that makes it even better , i will be getting me some posters ."
i am afraid of spiders . i would run and scream . what happened afterwards ?
oh no ! did it end up raining ? did you take rain gear ?
im sorry to hear that it can be hard
"that is so sweet of you . i love cats , you must be a caring spouse ."
i have heard that is a common side effect but you might want to talk to your doctor about it
its a good guard dog then
animal accidents can be really bad !
just cherish the moments
what kind of job is it
uh oh ! did you get in trouble ?
"awesome , congrats ! i am not too familiar with the oculus rift , is there a particular game you are eager to play ?"
ooh how so ? were there a lot of hills and sharp turns ?
i see . do you think you will be going back on that bike trail ?
what kind of con was it
that sounds amazing ! how did everyone do ?
why did you do tht ?
"i would imagine , that is a lot to drink !"
why is that ?
"i get that , did your friends know how to ride bikes ?"
aww that is sweet . did you cry ?
"oh , i am so sorry ! i used to have a dog we loved so much who had diabetes . . . we gave him insulin shots twice a day but we lost him . i can relate to how you feel . . ."
"oh no , what happened ?"
"oh dear , but are you allowed to sing at work ? that must be so annoying ."
"haha no way , i thought that only happens in cartoons !"
"that is unfortunate , is he doing any chemotherapy ?"
what were you waiting for !
how well did it work out for you ?
o no what did you do ?
oh no ! did you get hurt ?
do not be embarrassed . you know that you had a problem and you are better now for it
that is great to hear that things are going well for you .
how long has it been since the interview ?
oh that is awesome for your friend !
"that was probably not a good idea , how did it go for you ?"
that can be kind of scary . how did it go ?
good job . your coworker sounds like a shady little b ch did you let him her know what is up
aww haha how many bags did you bring
that sounds awful !
"i do not think that i have seen heard one of those since the s . . . possibly the early s at the earliest ! crazy , i did not know that they still exist either !"
"that is wonderful to hear , good for you . there is way too much craziness in the world making people unhappy . it is nice to hear someone is doing well and happy ."
"aw , that must have brought up a lot of nostalgia for you ."
"nice , a step up is always such a relief . do you feel confident you will get the job ?"
that is great . how long are you going to have to wait ?
i think we have all been there . . . i have done my fair share of dumbassery
"i know right ! i noticed leaves on the ground the other day and got all excited ! is autumn your favorite season , too ?"
"awe , sorry to hear that . i am sure you did better than you think ."
i was doing the same thing ! hard work but so satisfying when you see the results ! who is coming to stay ?
that sounds pretty disturbing . have you called the cops ?
"i certainly hope so , why do you want to move ?"
"hmm , do not you need fat and protein in your diet also ?"
oh wow ! that is a brave thing to do ! your letter must have been a little intense if you are worried how they will take it . how did it work out ?
oh man i would be mad too . . . you should wait outside with a paintball gun
terrifying ! what was it ?
oops . i hate when that happens . did they say anything to you ?
that sounds exciting ! do you bike a lot ?
how come you can not take them anymore ?
that is intense . i hope you did well !
i totally understand . the same thing happened to me last week . i thought i was going to lose it !
wow that is very clever . i would have never thought that could happen .
that is great ! hopefully he continues to be
oh no . that is so sad . was she sick for long ?
that is awful ! did you have insurance to cover everything ?
oh no ! i hope you did not get into too much trouble by doing so !
sounds like that could be fun if you like your brother and if you like parties . do you want to go ?
what was her reaction to that
that sounds like some nice relaxing quality time
have you ever passed out together watching tv ?
how old is your baby ?
that is exciting ! will it be your first house ?
you must really trust your friend ! how did that turn out ?
"oh no , what did you do ?"

haha caught red handed !
do not worry about it you will do fine . kindergarten is not too hard . just do not eat the glue .

surgery on my kids always scares me but i have heard that it is best to have them taken out while they are young
oh for sure . i hate having to cook and do dishes after a long hard day
"interesting . how do you feel about it ? do you find it fun and interesting , or wish she were more responsible with her money ?"
oh my gosh ! that had to be super scary !
yep i thinks its disrespectful and petty . what happened ?
sounds like your co workers respect you then
