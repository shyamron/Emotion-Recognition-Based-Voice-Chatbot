i like to look back at times of my childhood .
i got arrested when i was younger . i felt embarrassed to tell my parents
so i saw a guy at the gas station yesterday and he was over . . listening to nasty rap and of course he got out to use the free air pump then just threw it on the ground . they constantly have to replace it and it is the only free one in the area .
today i woke up to the sound of rain outside my window . it was so much better than my terrible alarm clock waking me up .
i knew my dad was going to heal . he was in the hospital but i had a good feeling
well when i was at the gas station yesterday i kept hearing a child scream i saw a lady park right in front and take a little boy in i thought it was him but she had left her little girl in the car alone !

i have always tried to be good to my family .
i just started the show luther on netflix .
"yesterday someone pulled up beside us in the gas station , blasting rap music . i was shocked when a middle aged white guy stepped out . it was super obnoxious , vile music too ."
"it was very random when it happen , but my grand ma passed away and it was sad . i did not expect it"
i am sticking by my partner even though he has done a lot because no one else has . while he is in therapy . it is hard . i do not know if he will get better but i guess it is worth a shot since no one else has ever helped him or been a good influence .
i was shamed when my dad got in trouble . it was just a little sad to be his son at the time
